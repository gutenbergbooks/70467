</div>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> letters were written many years ago, but
in China, and especially at Peking, the old order
changes slowly, and they are at any rate a
faithful record of the life which was led by those
whose duties lay, as the Chinese say, “within
the walls.” They profess no more than that.
Those who wish to learn more about China
and Chinese manners must go to that monumental
work of the late Dr. Wells Williams,
<i>The Middle Kingdom</i>, to Sir John Davies’s
fascinating book, <i>The Chinese</i>, or to Professor
Douglas’s book on Chinese society.</p>

<p>It will occur to many people to ask how it
comes that we should have lived for so many
years peacefully, travelling through the country
unarmed, in the midst of a people capable of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
the atrocities which have recently taken place.
China is of all countries the land of contradiction
and of paradox. But I think that those
who read these letters will see that though,
for obvious reasons, they were written in a
spirit of optimism, there was an undercurrent
of feeling that at any moment things might
become very different. For instance, if the
insurrection in Shantung had not been quelled,
and the rebels had marched upon Peking,
which was undoubtedly part of their programme,
the tragedy of 1900 might, and
probably would, have been anticipated in
1865. Moreover, although we were riding at
anchor in smooth water, there were from time
to time uncomfortable signs of disturbance
below. I remember how on more than one
occasion we were warned that on such and
such a day there would be a massacre of
Europeans for the old reason, the murder of
babies whose eyes were used for purposes of
photography. These stories were put about
by intriguing mandarins, who succeeded in
deceiving even some of the more ignorant of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span>
their own class. The famous General Tsêng
Kwo Fan (father of the Marquis Tsêng, who
was afterwards minister in London) was talking
one day with an English doctor on the subject
of this babies’-eyes fraud, when suddenly he
said, “It is no use your attempting to deny
it, for I have here some of the dried specimens,”
and he pulled out a packet of those
gelatine capsules which are used for covering
castor oil and other nauseous drugs! We paid
little heed to these warnings, though, as recent
events have proved, there was perhaps more
in them than we supposed. We were sitting
on a volcano, for experience has often shown
how swiftly this seemingly mild and almost
childlike people can be lashed into a fury like
that of the flaming legions of hell. One thing
we knew for certain. If a rising should take
place, we were in a death-trap from which
there could be no escape. Those grim and
frowning gates once shut, rescue was impossible,
for what could a mere handful of men—in
those days there were but some seventy or
eighty Europeans, all told, in Peking—avail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
against the seething mob of enraged devils?
When years afterwards, in 1879, there came
the horror of Sir Louis Cavagnari’s murder,
with all his company, at Cabul, I could but
think how much the position of the Legations
at Peking resembled his.</p>

<p>It is the fashion to belaud Japan for the
spirit of progress which she has shown, at
the expense of China, which remains wedded
to old ways and worn-out customs. Much as
we may admire the marvellous headway which
Japan has made, this is hardly quite fair.
It must be remembered that Japan has never
originated anything. All that she knew, up
to the time of her first real intercourse with
foreigners forty years ago, she owed to China.
Buddhism, which replaced and in some sort
throve hand-in-hand with the old ancestor
worship, the Shintô, reading and writing, every
art and accomplishment, from music and dancing
down to the game of football, all filtered
through Corea from China to Japan, and the
dates of their advent are solemnly recorded
as important facts in the <i lang="ja">O Dai Ichi Ran</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span>
“A Glance at the Generation of the Kings,”
the native history. Borrowers from the
beginning of time, it mattered little to the
Japanese whether they borrowed once more
or once less, and so when they saw that if they
wished to hold a place among the nations
their only chance was to get rid of ancient
Chinese forms and adopt the civilisation of
the West, they did not hesitate—they took a
leap into the light and left the thirteenth for
the nineteenth century. To hear some enthusiasts
talk one would almost be led to believe
that the Japanese invented the nineteenth
century. They found it ready made to their
hand. It was impossible to go through the
intermediate centuries. They had to skip,
and they did it with a will. The transformation
scene was as sudden as it was complete.
But it cost the Japanese no sacrifice of national
pride. What they gave up was none of their
own invention.</p>

<p>The Chinese, on the other hand, have an
autochthon civilisation of which they are justly
proud. Five hundred years before Christ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
came into the world—when the inhabitants
of these islands were hopeless savages clad in
skins, or stained with woad according to the
seasons, if the old stories be true—Confucius
was teaching respect for customs which were
already ancient. Since his day there have
been thirteen changes of capital and no fewer
than thirty dynasties, but even when Tartar<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
emperors have sat upon the Dragon Throne
they have been compelled to follow the rules
of the Chinese, and civilisation has remained
what it was “under the shadow” of the great
Teacher. No wonder that the son of Han
thinks a good many times before he will
scatter his past to the four winds of heaven,
as the Japanese did without a sigh!</p>

<p>In one sense the mandarins have been wiser
in their generation than the men who made the
Japanese revolution of 1868. These were the
daimios, such men as Satsuma, Tosa, Choshiu,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span>
and their karôs (elders or councillors), who
thinking to overthrow the Tycoon and his rule,
were blind to the fact that in so doing they were
working their own downfall as well as his. For
they, no less than he, were the embodiment of
the feudal system. Where are they now? <i lang="fr">Où
sont les neiges d’antan?</i> They have vanished,
and their places are filled by a mushroom growth
of dukes, marquises, counts, viscounts, and
barons. For Japan has stopped short at nothing;
not content with adopting the cocked hat, which
as we all know is the very marrow of all good
government, giving the <i lang="fr">entrée</i> to the comity of
nations, she has actually invented a full and
complete peerage. Far more astute is the
mandarin. Such wily anachronisms as Li Hung
Chang and his compeers know full well that
under the sun of Western civilisation they must
melt away, and it is no matter for surprise that
they die hard. All the myriads of officials,
from the highest to the lowest, swarming like
ants over that vast empire, are alive to the fact
that their very existence depends on keeping up
a constant animosity against the Hung Kwei<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[xii]</span>
Tzŭ, the red devils. That has always appeared
to me as the keynote of the situation.</p>

<p>Various causes are commonly assigned for
the fanaticism against foreigners, which has from
time to time broken out with fatal consequences
in different parts of China. Some blame
missionary enterprise; some commerce in
general; others the opium trade in particular.
My belief is that it is due to neither of these in
itself, but to the dread of reform which haunts
the official mind, and which in the end must
win its way.</p>

<p>The Chinese are not by nature a people of
strong religious convictions, nor have they any
strong religious antipathies. If it were otherwise,
how is it that a colony of Jews<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> has dwelt
among them unmolested for two thousand years,
and still remains, dwindling in numbers, it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</span>
true, at Kai Fêng in the province of Ho Nan?
How is it that the Mohammedans have flourished
exceedingly in certain provinces, even to
becoming a danger to the empire? On the
walls of the Imperial palace at Peking there is a
pavilion richly decorated with Arabic inscriptions
from the Koran in honour of a Mohammedan
lady who was a wife, or favourite, of one of the
emperors. This does not look like persecution
for religion’s sake. And, more than these,
Buddhism? Ever since the Emperor Ming Ti
dreamt a dream, nearly nineteen centuries ago,
and sent for Buddhist books and images to
China, Buddhism has been the popular religion,
as Confucianism is the popular school of moral
philosophy. Tao-ism, the native religion of Lao
Tsŭ, cannot hold its own with it. Troublous
days, indeed, it has gone through at various
times, but it has outlived them, and now, to
quote Dr. Morrison, “Buddhism in China is
decried by the learned, laughed at by the profligate,
yet followed by all.” (See further Wells
Williams, <i>ut suprà</i>.)</p>

<p>Why, then, this tolerance in certain cases,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</span>side by side with the cruellest intolerance where
Christianity is concerned? If it is not religious
conviction, it must be political antipathy. And
there is the rub. The bitter hatred of Christianity
is not inborn in the people, who have in
many instances, indeed, shown a sort of limp
willingness, not altogether unconnected with
better wages, to embrace its tenets; but the
hostility is bred, fostered, and fomented by the
mandarins to whom it means the end of their
rule. Under a Christian dispensation the whole
tottering fabric of their power must inevitably
fall to the ground. The poor Jews were to
them a negligible quantity. The Mohammedan
creed, the sacred book of which may
not be translated, presents for that reason but
small terrors to the lettered class, though we
hear of an old prophecy to the effect that there
will be a great Mohammedan revolution, and
that a Hui-Hui (Mohammedan) dynasty shall
rule over China. Buddhism, on the other hand,
except in Tibet, aims at no temporal power, and
even there the Chinese Emperor is the Suzerain.
But Christianity is a very real terror, to be put
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[xv]</span>down at any cost, however bloody. And yet,
strange to say, there was a time when it seemed
as if it were destined to conquer everything and
to become the state religion. Internal dissensions
and ambitions amongst its sects alone
stopped its course.</p>

<p>The history of the early missions to China
is full of interest; it is not possible, however, to
do more than glance at it here. Putting on
one side the dim legend that St. Thomas, the
doubting apostle, was the first to preach the
Gospel to the Chinese, there is no doubt that
missionaries did visit them in very remote ages.
It was two Nestorian monks who carried the
first Eastern silkworms’ eggs to Justinian in the
sixth century (see my <i>Bamboo Garden</i>, pp. 31–33).
It is strange at the present time to read how at
the end of the thirteenth century John of Monte
Corvino was sent by Pope Nicholas the Fourth
to the court of Kublai Khan at Kambaluk (the
ancient name of Peking); how he was kindly
entreated there, building a church “which had
a steeple and belfry, with three bells that were
rung every hour to summon the new converts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</span>to prayer”; how he baptized nearly six thousand
persons during that time, “and bought one
hundred and fifty children, whom he instructed
in Greek and Latin, composing for them several
devotional books.” Clement the Fifth made him
an archbishop, and sent him seven suffragan
bishops. He died full of years in 1328, “having
converted more than thirty thousand infidels.”
All Kambaluk is said to have mourned for him,
Christians and heathen rending their garments
at his funeral, and his tomb became the resort
of pious pilgrims. This account, which will be
found given at length in the third volume of the
<i>Chinese Repository</i>, is probably not a little
exaggerated; but even discounting it largely, it
is very striking as an evidence of devotion on
the one side and toleration on the other. “It
is now twelve years,” he wrote, “since I have
heard any news of the west. I am become old
and gray-headed, but it is rather through
labours and tribulations than through age, for I
am only fifty-eight years old. I have learned
the Tartar language and literature, into which
I have translated the whole New Testament<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</span>
and the Psalms of David, and have caused them
to be transcribed with the utmost care. I write
and read and preach openly and freely the
testimony of the law of God.” Until the year
1368, when the Yuan or Tartar dynasty was
driven out by the Chinese, and the Ming
Emperors ruled first at Nanking and afterwards
at Peking, Dr. Williams says “there is no
reasonable doubt that the greater part of
Central Asia and Northern China was the scene
of many flourishing Christian communities.”
From that time forth, during upwards of two
hundred years, they dwindled away so that
nothing more was heard of them.</p>

<p>It was at the end of the sixteenth century
that the Jesuits first began to exercise an influence
which was very nearly overwhelming
all rivalry in China. Saint François Xavier,
the gospeller of India and Japan, had marked
China as the special field of his future labours,
but he died of fever at the island of Shang
Chuen, near Macao, being only forty-six years
old at the time of his death—a wonderful man,
truly! But his work was destined to fall into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</span>
hands no less competent for the task than
his own.</p>

<p>Matteo Ricci, the famous Jesuit father,
was born at Macerata, in the Papal States, in
1552. At the age of nineteen he was sent to
Rome to study law, which career he quickly
abandoned, to his father’s great displeasure, to
enter the Society of Jesus. Here he came
under the orders of Father Valignani, the
Inspector-General of Eastern Missions, with
whom, before he had even finished his noviciate,
he went to India, continuing his studies
at Goa, where he became professor of philosophy.
In 1580 he followed Father Ruggiero
to Macao, where the two priests gave themselves
up to the study of the Chinese language.
They availed themselves of the trading privileges
of the Portuguese to visit Canton, and
some two years later, not without encountering
some difficulties and disappointments, they obtained
the permission of the Viceroy of Kwang
Tung to build a house at Shao Ching Fu, and
a church. Ricci soon saw that a reputation
for learning was then, as now, the only passport<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">[xix]</span>
to high consideration among the lettered
classes. He published a map of China and a
catechism, in which he set forth the moral
teaching of Christianity, excluding carefully all
that pertains to the doctrines of revealed religion.
He had his reward, for many learned
men came to consult him, and his fame spread
far and wide. For some years the Jesuit
fathers adopted the garments of Buddhist
priests, but finding that these were treated with
anything but respect, they, upon the advice of
Father Valignani, dropped the yellow robes
and assumed the garb of the men of letters,
whom above all it was their wise endeavour to
conciliate. Ricci paid three visits to Nanking,
but on the second occasion he was expelled,
and forced to go to Nanchang, where he established
a school and published two treatises,
the <i>Art of Memory</i> and a <i>Dialogue on Friendship</i>.
This last work was a marvellous success,
for it became famous not only “for the loftiness
of its thoughts, but even for the purity of its
style,” a feat perhaps unique in a country where
literary style is so much thought of, and so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">[xx]</span>
difficult to attain, even by native scholars. In
the year 1600 he achieved his ambition of
going to Peking charged with presents for the
Emperor Wan Li from the Portuguese at
Macao. But the mission was not accomplished
without difficulty. A eunuch of the court had
offered himself as his escort, and with him
Ricci set out in a native junk. But the presents
of which he was the bearer had aroused
the cupidity of the eunuch, who contrived to
imprison Ricci and his companion Pantoja at
Tientsing for six months. Happily the affair
came to the ears of the Emperor, who ordered
him to be released and brought to Peking,
where he was kindly received by Wan Li, who
assigned him a house and salary. Ricci soon
made many friends and converts, of whom one
named Sü helped him in the translation of
Euclid. His secret of success was being all
things to all men, and he contrived so to edit
Christianity as to make it fit in with existing
manners and customs, and to give offence to
none. Among other things he allowed the
rites of ancestral worship to be continued,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</span>
affecting to consider them as being of a civil
and not of a religious character. In short, he
followed the Buddhist system of incorporating,
not condemning, those articles of native faith
to have fought against which would have been
fatal to his schemes. Father Ricci died in
1610, being fifty-eight years of age. If, on
account of the laxity of his theological concessions,
he cannot be called a great Christian
missionary, he was at any rate a great conciliator,
and it was no fault of his that the seed
which he successfully sowed did not bring forth
good fruit. He was possessed of rare talents,
his learning was conspicuous in many branches,
and his winning charm of manner commended
him to the favour of high and low. He was
perhaps the only European who ever acquired
the Chinese literary style to such a degree as
to call forth the admiration of native critics.
To such an extent was this recognised, that
about 150 years after his death his treatise
on <i>The True Doctrine of God</i>, revised by a
minister of state named Sin, was included
in the collection of the best Chinese works<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</span>
made by the order of the Emperor Chien
Lung.</p>

<p>To follow a man so various and so plastic
as Ricci was no easy task; but the Society of
Jesus has never been wanting in men possessed
at any rate of the latter quality, and Father
Longobardi proved an efficient successor,
though he did not make history. But there
were troubles in store for the missionaries.
Their successes aroused the jealousies of
courtiers and officials, whose intrigues led to
the publication of an edict banishing the Christian
teachers. This decree, however, was
never carried into effect. They had made
many converts who protected them, and foremost
among these were Sü (Ricci’s special
friend) and his daughter, christened under the
name of Candida. These two Chinese converts
were so famous for their virtues and so
beloved for their charity, that they are actually
worshipped to this day by the people at
Shanghai, and the Roman Catholic Mission
at Sü Chia Wei, near that city, occupies the
property once held by the Christian Sü.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</span>
Candida was indeed a saintly woman. She built
no fewer than thirty-nine churches; she published
upwards of one hundred books; she
established a foundling hospital for babies
whom, then as now, their unnatural parents
were in the habit of abandoning; and she
employed the blind improvisatori of the streets
to substitute Gospel stories for their obscenities
and inanities. The Emperor himself conferred
upon her the title of “The Virtuous Woman,”
and sent her a robe and headgear embroidered
with pearls, which she stripped off to further
her religious works with their price.</p>

<p>The beginning of the seventeenth century
was a time of internal trouble and revolution
in China. The old Chinese dynasty of the
Mings was about to be replaced by the present
Tartar dynasty, the Chi̔ng. That the Jesuits
had become a real power in the land is proved
by the fact that the claimant to the Ming
throne was supported by the missionaries, his
troops being led by two native Christian
generals, Kiu who was called Thomas, and
Chin who was baptized Luke. His mother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</span>
wife, and son were christened as Helena,
Maria, and Constantine, and Helena went so
far as to write to Pope Alexander VII.
“expressing her attachment to the cause of
Christianity, and wishing to put the country,
through him, under the protection of God”!
(Wells Williams).</p>

<p>The Jesuits held a high position in the early
days of the Tartar rule. This was due to the
pre-eminent abilities of their leader, Johann
Adam Schall, a man of good family, native of
Cologne. This great priest was born in A.D.
1591, and entered the Society of Jesus at
Rome in 1611. There he became a student
of theology and mathematics, and left for
China in 1622. His great learning won for
him such renown that he was sent for by the
Emperor in 1631, installed at Peking as court
astronomer, and charged with the revision of
the Chinese calendar. Needless to say this
position was not won without exciting great
jealousy among the native men of science, who
attacked him fiercely, both openly and in secret.
But his correct calculation of an eclipse, as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</span>
which they were hopelessly wrong, defeated all
their intrigues, and he was more than ever in
favour with the Emperor Chung Ch’êng (the
last of the Mings), who, in dread of the Tartars,
caused him, much against his will, to start a
cannon foundry, rewarding him with a pompous
autograph inscription in praise of his science
and virtue. When at last the Tartars became
masters of Peking, Schall, though in continual
danger himself, was able to give effectual protection
to the Christian converts. It cannot
fail to strike us with amazement that, like the
Vicar of Bray, when matters settled down,
Schall should have enjoyed even more favour
under the Tartar Emperor Shun Chih than he
had done under his Ming predecessor; and
when, at that sovereign’s death in 1662, he
actually was holding the post of tutor to the
young Emperor Káng Hsi, who became one
of the most famous monarchs that ever ruled
in China, it seemed as if nothing could arrest
the progress of Jesuit influence.</p>

<p>But the supreme power was for a time in
the hands of four regents who were opposed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</span>
the Christians, and a memorial was presented
to court denouncing the new sect as dangerous
to the state. The Dominicans and Franciscans,
of whom I shall speak presently, had,
during a quarter of a century and more, been
working in opposition to the Jesuits, and the
internal dissensions of the sects gave their
enemies an opportunity of which they were not
slow to avail themselves. The memorial, a
remarkable document, calls attention to the
strife between the orders as to the worship of
Ti̔en (Heaven) and Shang Ti (God), which
dissensions as to the principle of doctrine show
the true aspirations of the rival sects to be
political; and in this connection the memorialists
call attention to the schisms and civil war
to which Christianity gave rise in Japan, evils
which could not fail to occur sooner or later
in China if the missionaries were allowed to
remain there. The regents, nothing loth,
yielded to the wishes of the memorialists, and
in 1665 the Christian teachers were proscribed
as seducers of the people, leading them into a
false path. Father Schall died miserably at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</span>
the age of seventy-eight, after having been for
thirty-seven years the trusted and favoured
servant of five emperors. His converts were
degraded, and his colleagues imprisoned or
banished.</p>

<p>Among those who were held in chains,
beaten, and subjected to every indignity, was
Father Verbiest, a native of Flanders, partly
educated at Seville, the third of the great triad
of priests who, by their talents, their learning,
and their personal charm, so nearly succeeded
in turning the current of Chinese history. For
six long years who shall say what he suffered?
Six years of the horrors of a Chinese prison!
At last, however, the minority of the Emperor
Ka̔ng Hsi came to an end. He had not forgotten
the good teaching of Father Schall, and
one of his earliest acts, on assuming the power
in 1671, was to release the priests, with Father
Verbiest at their head. Ka̔ng Hsi was not a
Christian; but though he forbade his subjects
to follow the new teaching, he was sufficiently
liberal to put an end to persecution, and to
recognise the value of Western learning.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</span>
There is a myth to the effect that an earthquake
was the immediate cause of the release,
but the truth is that the Emperor wanted
Verbiest’s astronomical science to set straight
the crooked inventions of the native professors.
The father was appointed court astronomer
and chief mathematician. He was also ordered,
as Schall had been, to cast cannon, which, with
much pomp and ceremony, robed as for mass,
he blessed, in the presence of the court,
sprinkling them with holy water, and giving
to each the name of a female saint which he
had himself drawn on the breech. This
brought him a letter from Pope Innocent XI.,
praising him for having so wisely brought the
profane sciences into play for the salvation of
Chinese souls. To Father Verbiest are due
the wonderful mathematical instruments of
bronze, beautiful as works of art, which are
still one of the sights of Peking. They are in
the Observatory at the southern corner of the
Tartar city, where they remain as the last witnesses
of the Jesuit greatness. Verbiest died
in 1688, and the Emperor himself composed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</span>
the funeral oration, which was read with great
pomp before his coffin. No three men ever
succeeded in obtaining the favour of the
Chinese court so signally as the three Jesuit
fathers, Ricci, Schall, and Verbiest. When
Father Verbiest died there was no man with
a sufficiently commanding intellect to fill his
place and continue his work.</p>

<p>It is conceivable that if they had not been
thwarted by the Dominicans and the Franciscans,
the Jesuits might have succeeded in
their ambition even to the extent of Christianising
China. But those two sects effectually
put a stop to the process of conversion. The
great bone of contention was the so-called worship
of ancestors and of Confucius. Another
point was the translation of the name of God
by Ti̔en, literally Heaven, and Shang Ti, for
which there is indeed no other rendering. This
last controversy, which has in it much that is
childish, and mere splitting of hairs, is not worth
discussing. The great point was to render
the Sacred Name by some term that should be
intelligible to the Chinese mind. Both seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</span>
to fulfil that condition. As regards the former
question, we have seen how Father Ricci dealt
with it. He saw the wisdom of not repelling
the Chinese by at once condemning a custom
to which they were so wedded that any attempt
to do away with it would evidently alienate
them altogether, so he, a true Jesuit, effected
a clever compromise, treating the rites in
honour of ancestors and of Confucius as civil
and not as religious ceremonies. It always
has seemed to me that he acted wisely, for
in no other way could he have hoped to obtain
any hearing. By degrees the Christianised
Chinese might have been weaned from their
old practices, and Christianity in all its purity
have been made a dominant religion. This,
however, is mere speculation.</p>

<p>When the Dominicans and Franciscans
became aware of the successes of the Jesuits,
they too resolved to have their share in the
work, and they promptly sent out missions to
China on their own account. But their school
lacked the liberality and plastic nature of the
Jesuits. They resolutely refused any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</span>
compromise. They accused the Jesuits of countenancing
idolatry and heathen practices, and
one Morales, a Spanish Dominican, sent home
a report to the Propaganda to that effect.
This produced a decree from Pope Innocent
the Tenth, in which the conduct of the Jesuits
was censured and their doctrine condemned
in 1645. It took the Jesuits eleven years to
procure from Pope Alexander VII. another
Bull, not indeed contradicting that of Pope
Innocent, but one which might be so read as
to give them a free hand. But the battle was
not over, for in 1693 Bishop Maigrot, Vicar
Apostolic in China, declared in the face of the
Inquisition and the Pope that Ti̔en meant the
material heaven, and not God, and that the
worship of ancestors was idolatrous. In this
difficulty it is not a little strange to find that
the Jesuits appealed to the Emperor Ka̔ng Hsi
to show them the way out. They addressed
him in a memorial which is quoted at length
by Wells Williams from the <i>Life of St.
Martin</i>, and which is so curious that I am
tempted to transcribe it, the more so as <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</span>it
shows so clearly all the points of the great
controversy:—</p>

<p>“We, your faithful subjects, although originally
from distant countries, respectfully supplicate
your Majesty to give us clear instructions
on the following points. The scholars of
Europe have understood that the Chinese
practise certain ceremonies in honour of Confucius;
that they offer sacrifices to Heaven,
and that they observe peculiar rites towards
their ancestors; but persuaded that these ceremonies,
sacrifices, and rites are founded in
reason, though ignorant of their true intention,
earnestly desire us to inform them. We have
always supposed that Confucius was honoured
in China as a legislator, and that it was in this
character alone, and with this view solely, that
the ceremonies established in his honour were
practised. We believe that the rites in honour
of ancestors are only observed in order to
exhibit the love felt for them, and to hallow
the remembrance of the good received from
them during their life. We believe that the
sacrifices offered to Heaven are not tendered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</span>
to the visible heavens which are seen above
us, but to the Supreme Master, Author, and
Preserver of heaven and earth, and of all they
contain. Such are the interpretation and the
sense which we have always given to these
Chinese ceremonies; but as strangers cannot
be considered competent to pronounce on these
important points with the same certainty as
the Chinese themselves, we presume to request
your Majesty not to refuse to give us the
explanations which we desire concerning
them. We wait for them with respect and
submission.”</p>

<p>Ka̔ng Hsi cut the Gordian knot by declaring
that “Ti̔en means the true God, and that
the customs of China are political.” In spite
of this Imperial opinion Pope Clement XI.
upheld Bishop Maigrot, declared that Ti̔en
Chu, Lord of Heaven, must be the name for
God, Ti̔en and Shang Ti being altogether
inadmissible.</p>

<p>Tournon, Patriarch of Antioch, was sent
to Peking, where at an audience of Ka̔ng Hsi
the Emperor demanded to be informed of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</span>
decision of the Pope. When Ka̔ng Hsi learnt
that a Pope of Rome had ventured to give an
opinion contrary to his own in a matter which
was altogether Chinese, and in part purely
linguistic, he was furious, and issued a decree
declaring that the Jesuits should be protected,
but the followers of Bishop Maigrot should be
persecuted. The Patriarch Tournon was
banished to Macao, where further difficulties
arose between him and the bishop of that
diocese, who went so far as to imprison the
legate in a private house, where he died. A
second legate was sent to Peking in 1715 in
the person of one Mezzabarba. Ka̔ng Hsi
received him civilly, but would not talk about
rites, and after six years fruitlessly spent he
returned to Europe.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the eighteenth century
it is claimed that there were in the provinces
of the two Chiangs alone one hundred churches
and a hundred thousand Christians. Those
were the palmy days of missionary enterprise,
but they did not last long. The quarrels of
the missionaries amongst themselves, their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</span>
political ambitions, which it was represented
constituted a danger to the state, disgusted
Ka̔ng Hsi. The Jesuits, indeed, he continued
to tolerate, forbidding any priests but those
who would follow the rules of Ricci to remain
in China. In 1723 Ka̔ng Hsi died, and was
succeeded by his son Yung Chêng, who in the
following year issued an edict strictly forbidding
the propagation of the Christian religion. A
few missionaries were retained at Peking on
account of their scientific acquirements, but
the majority were banished to the south. The
native Christians in the north were left as a
flock without shepherds; they were subjected
to extortion and blackmailing of the worst
description, and although many remained
faithful and even contrived to harbour their
teachers secretly, this edict of Yung Chêng
gave the death-blow to an energy which had
made itself powerfully felt for a century and
a quarter.</p>

<p>I have been led further afield than I intended
in this sketch of the Jesuit enterprise
(based mainly upon Dr. Wells Williams’s book<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</span>
and on the <i>Biographie Universelle</i>), but it is a
fascinating subject, and few people outside of
those personally interested in China know how
nearly at one time the Christian religion seemed
to be reaching a great triumph. The story of
Ricci, Schall, and Verbiest teaches one great
truth. If missionaries are to be successful it
must be by the power of masterly talent and
knowledge. They can only work on any scale
through the lettered class, and in order to
dominate them must be able to give proof of
superior attainments as the old Jesuits did.
With courage, devotion, self-sacrifice, our missionaries
are largely endowed. They have
given proofs of these, even to the laying down
of their lives; but these qualities are as nothing
in the eyes of the cultivated Confucian. One
such convert as Schall’s friend Sü and his
daughter Candida would do more towards
Christianising China than thousands of poor
peasants. To make such a convert needs
qualifications which are rare indeed. Above
all things an accurate and scholarly knowledge
of the language is necessary. There have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</span>
been not a few excellent scholars among our
missionaries. But there are many more whose
ignorance in that respect has been fatal,
covering themselves and the religion which
they preach with ridicule. Fancy a Chinese
Buddhist mounting on the roof of a hansom
cab at Charing Cross and preaching Buddhism
to the mob in pidgin English! That would
give some measure of the effect produced on a
Chinese crowd by a missionary whom I have
seen perched upon a cart outside the great gate
of the Tartar City at Peking, haranguing a
yellow crowd of gapers in bastard Chinese,
delivered with a strong Aberdonian accent.
The Jesuits knew better than that.</p>

<p>Not an uncommon argument in support of
the truths of Christianity is to call attention to
the purity of the lives of the missionaries. I
find a note of a conversation on this subject in
my Journals. “Venerable sir,” answered the
learned and respectable Kung, “the goodness
of a dumpling does not depend upon the pucker
at the top of it. You can no more judge a
man’s merits by his outward seeming than you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</span>
can mete out the sea in a bushel measure. It
is true that to all appearance your missionaries
lead very pure lives; but to all appearance so
do our people. Look at Mr. Li and Mr. Pao,
who live in my street. Nothing can be more
respectable than their outward demeanour, yet
we know perfectly well that Mr. Li sleeps in
flowers and closes his eyes in willows” (a
metaphorical expression for leading a dissolute
life), “while as for Mr. Pao, the less said
about him the better. What guarantee have
I that these men, whose excellence you extol,
are not like my neighbours Li and Pao? Since
I must doubt even that which passes before
my eyes, how can I believe that which comes
to me only by hearsay? The proverb says,
‘If your front teeth are knocked out, swallow
them.’ Nobody publishes his own misfortune
or his own disgrace.”</p>

<p>The Chinaman knew his own country well.
Virtue without the supremest power of science
and education is not enough to carry conviction
to the man of letters.</p>

<p>At any rate, the history of the great Jesuit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxix">[xxxix]</span>
movement proves my point that the spirit of
religious intolerance is not a fault which can
fairly be laid to the charge of “The Hundred
Names,” as the οἱ πολλοί of China call themselves,
and that where it has shown itself it has
been engendered and fostered by the fears of
the officials. It is the same with trade. The
rulers and not the ruled are the authors of all
difficulties. The Chinaman is a born trader.
Buying, selling, and barter are the very joy of
his life, and so long as he can get the better of
a bargain what cares he with whom he deals?
Foreigner or fellow-countryman, it is all one
to him.</p>

<p>The third source to which hatred of
foreigners is ascribed is opium. That has
been dealt with so recently by a Royal Commission
that there is nothing new to be said
upon the subject. All I can say, speaking from
personal observation, is that I have known
some hundreds of Chinese of all classes who
were opium smokers. None of them abused
the drug. They regarded it as a most valuable
prophylactic against fever and ague, and would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xl">[xl]</span>
have been very loth to do without it. Some
were literary men and officials doing hard brainwork;
others, like a travelling pedlar whom I
met on one of my Mongolian excursions, were
doing equally hard bodily work. The abuse of
opium has, so far as I can judge, been grossly
exaggerated. It cannot be denied that there
are to be seen in the opium dens of great cities
a few poor wretches who have reduced themselves
to a state of abject degradation by their
intemperance; but their percentage must be
small indeed compared to that of the victims
of alcohol who are the disgrace of our own
towns, and at any rate, as has been cunningly
observed, they do not go home and beat their
wives. To deprive the Chinaman of the finest
qualities of Indian opium would be to condemn
him to the use of the miserable substitute which
he grows in his own fields. It would be like
forbidding the importation of champagne and
Château Lafitte into England, and driving our
epicures and invalids to the necessity of falling
back upon cheap and nasty stimulants.
If the opium trade were to be abolished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xli">[xli]</span>
to-morrow it is my firm conviction that it
would spring up again immediately, but under
altered conditions and in native hands. If it
be thought that I am wrong in what I say as
to the use of opium, read what Dr. Morrison
says in his delightful book, <i>An Australian in
China</i>. There you have the independent
testimony of a competent physician who has
travelled over the whole of China from east to
west, and who has dealt exhaustively with the
question. No one has had better opportunities
of judging. No opinion is worthy of more
respect.</p>

<p>My conclusion then is that neither the religion
of the missionaries, nor the trade of the
merchants, nor even the much-abused drug,
can honestly be counted as the cause of the
anti-foreign movement in China, though one
and all have been used as levers to envenom it.
Foreign intercourse in any shape is the bugbear
of the mandarin, as being the one standing
danger threatening abolition of himself and his
privileges, of which the two most dearly prized
are robbery and cruelty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlii">[xlii]</span></p>

<p>Let us be just, however, even to the mandarin.
It often happens that the missionaries
are surrounded by natives of bad character,
who hang on to them for protection. Especially
is this the case with certain Roman
Catholics, who have always endeavoured to
“extra-territorialise” their converts, that is, to
exact for them the same privileges of immunity
from Chinese jurisdiction as are granted to the
subjects of their own country. It is easy to
see how this may give just cause of offence to
the officials, and how readily a cunning malefactor
will run to his priest to shelter his back
from the bamboo rod, swearing that the charge
brought against him is a mere pretext, his profession
of the Christian faith, in which he is
protected by treaty, being the real offence.
Full of righteous indignation and confidence in
the truth of his convert, who, being a Christian,
must necessarily be believed before his heathen
accuser, the priest rushes off to the magistrate’s
office to plead the cause of his protégé. The
magistrate finds the man guilty and punishes
him; the priest is stout in his defence;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xliii">[xliii]</span> a
diplomatic correspondence ensues, and on both
sides the vials of wrath are poured out. How
can a priest who interferes, and the mandarin
who is interfered with, love one another?
Some instances there have been where the
priests have gone a step farther, and have
actually urged their disciples to own no allegiance
to their native authorities, but to obey
only themselves as representatives of the
Sovereign Pontiff of Rome.</p>

<p>The missionaries, on the other hand, of the
China Inland Mission put forth no such pretensions,
and excite no such animosities.</p>

<p>The jealousies of the different sects of
Christianity among themselves throw as great
difficulties in the way of conversion to-day
as they did in Ka̔ng Hsi’s time. A highly-educated
Chinese gentleman, who had been
making inquiries into the doctrines of Christianity,
once appealed to me on the subject.
“How is it,” he asked, “that if I go to one
teacher and talk to him of what I have learnt
from another he answers me, ‘No, that is not
right; that is the doctrine preached by So-and-So;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xliv">[xliv]</span>
if you follow him you will go to hell’?”
But that one missionary should speak of the
Church of another Christian as a “Scarlet
Woman” appeared to him to be altogether
lacking in decorum. It must be a puzzle—yet
not worse than the various schools of
Buddhism.</p>

<p>It used to be a cardinal article of faith
among Europeans in China during the fifties,
that if once we could throw Peking open to
foreign diplomacy all would be well. That
was to be the sovereign cure for all the ills of
which we had to complain. We should be in
touch with the Emperor and his court, and we
could not fail to convert the most recalcitrant
of mandarins to the adoption of our Western
civilisation: perhaps even China might become
a Christian country. We have now been at
Peking for forty years, during which time
successive ministers of all countries have
preached, flattered, scolded, and threatened
over the sweetmeats and tea of the Tsung-Li
Yamên, and what is the result to-day?</p>

<p>What really was wanted was not to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlv">[xlv]</span>get
into Peking ourselves, but to get the Emperor
with his court and Government out of it. This
is no new theory of mine. So confident have
I always been that Peking is the worst capital
on all grounds for China, that thirty years ago,
writing in <i>Macmillan’s Magazine</i> of the Tientsing
massacre in 1870, I said, “This time we
hope that the past will be a lesson for the
future, and that such conditions will be imposed
as will secure our countrymen, be they laymen
or missionaries, from outrage, and will prevent
China from remaining the one bar to the
progress and civilisation of the world. It is
not within the province of a magazine article
to suggest what those conditions should be;
but we cannot help hinting that if the treaty
powers were to treat China as Peter the Great
did Russia, and transplant the capital and
court from Peking back to Nanking, whence
it was removed by the Emperor Tai Tsung,
who reigned under the style of Yung Lo
at the beginning of the fifteenth century,
the headquarters of obstructiveness and mandarinism
would be destroyed, the power of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlvi">[xlvi]</span> the
viceroys would be brought under the control
of the central Government, and a new era
might be inaugurated which should be as
conducive to the welfare and happiness of the
Chinese people as to the safety and profits of
the European trader. Above all, the representatives
of European powers, instead of
being boxed up in Peking like rats in a trap,
would in the not improbable event of their
having from time to time certain demands and
requisitions to make of the Chinese Government,
be backed up by the presence of their
men of war on the spot. It is wonderful how
distance weakens a threat, and how wholesomely
the sight of power acts upon the
Oriental mind.”</p>

<p>Subsequent events have not led me to alter
an opinion formed so many years ago. So
long as Peking remains the capital so long
will it be impossible to bring home to the
Government certain facts which are well known
to many of the provincial governors, but which
only in rare instances they dare to report to
headquarters. It is not conceivable that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlvii">[xlvii]</span> if
the Empress Tsŭ Hsi had known what a
hornet’s nest she was stirring, she would have
acted as she must have done in encouraging
Prince Tuan and the Boxers. But it is a far
cry to Peking.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that the policy of foreign
governments in China has been calculated to
raise the powers in the estimate of those very
Chinese whom it ought to be our chief duty
to impress. Take the outrages upon missionaries
and the constant murders of which we
have had to complain—until the German
Emperor seized Kwei Chao we have always
been content to accept a money indemnity as
reparation; so that the local mandarins must
have looked upon the death of a few missionaries—the
most sweet-smelling offering that
could be made to Tsŭ Hsi and her eunuchs—as
a mere question of cost, and that moreover
not to be defrayed by themselves, but
squeezed out of the people. If some poor
wretch or wretches were decapitated, the
instigator, the real culprit, could enjoy the
luxury of sitting in judgment over his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlviii">[xlviii]</span>
crime, and sentencing to death some victim
caught at random out of the prisons, or perhaps
even—for Chinese methods are ingenious—paying
off an old score.</p>

<p>As regards intercourse with the ruling
classes, or obtaining any influence with the
court, our presence at Peking has been
useless—perhaps worse than useless, actually
mischievous. For what can a Chinese gentleman
think when he sees the filthiest beggar
pass freely without let or hindrance in parts
of the city where the presence of the minister
of the proudest nation in Europe would be
deemed a pollution? We have been tolerated
in Peking as a necessary evil—accepted we
have never been. The receptions at court
have been so rare, and made such a great
favour of, that they have been a mere farce,
and in some cases, such as the visit of the
ladies of the <i lang="fr">Corps diplomatique</i> to the Empress
Tsŭ Hsi, a degradation. Compare with
the position of the British Minister at Peking—stoned
and insulted in the streets, and unable
to obtain protection or redress—the reception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlix">[xlix]</span>
of Li Hung Chang by all Europe three years
ago. How that astute old intriguer must have
laughed in his sleeve when he found himself
petted, coaxed, and flattered, treated like a
royal personage! and what must have been
the inference drawn by every ignorant Chinese,
from Tsŭ Hsi and the poor down-trampled
Emperor Kwang Hsu down to the meanest
beggar on the bridge? Crystal is not so clear
as the fact that the Son of Heaven is the
ruler of the world, and all other monarchs
mere vassals, doing homage to the steps of the
Jasper Throne.</p>

<p>Peking has exercised upon foreign representatives
a sort of unholy glamour. They
have been bewitched. Some have fallen down
and worshipped before its scholastic and historical
traditions; others have treated the great
city and its rulers as a sort of gigantic “curio”;
optimism has been the bane of all. If any
serious attempt has been made to bring the
mandarins into the pale of statesmanship it has
been singularly unsuccessful. They remain as
retrograde and as hopelessly obstructive as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_l">[l]</span>
ever. They have occasionally been clever
enough, like Li, to throw dust in the eyes of
foreigners, and that is all. Unless a radical
change is effected European diplomacy will
continue to be abortive; to effect that change
it is absolutely necessary that the court should
be removed from the headquarters of obstruction,
and brought into actual contact with our
civilisation and with the material evidence of
Western power. The old-world prejudices of
Moscow were a hindrance to Peter the Great;
the Kugés buried for centuries at Kiyôto were
a drag upon the reformers of Japan; the
capitals were moved. These are the two
great precedents for such a policy.</p>

<p>In spite of protesting princes and potentates,
it seems as if the partition of China, that unwieldy
monster, was at hand. When the
phrases “Sphere of Influence” and “Hinterland,”
diplomatic expressions recently invented
for the benefit of savage Africa, came, three or
four years ago, to be applied to China, then
nominally a friendly power, it was not difficult
to foresee what must follow. The events of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_li">[li]</span>
the last three months have precipitated matters.
Germany is in honour bound to exact exemplary
retribution for the murder of her minister,
the deadliest insult that could be offered to a
great nation. If she were minded to take
Shantung, where she might establish a flourishing
colony, she would act as a buffer state
between Central China and Russia, who has
already to all intents possessed herself of
Manchuria, and has for many a year cast
longing eyes upon Chihli; and after all, if
Russia were to annex Chihli with Peking
would the world have any great cause for
lamentation? Apart from all other considerations,
Russia with a nucleus of co-religionists
in the Albazines, of whom there is a short
account at p. 211 of these letters, would have
more in hand towards Christianising the people
than any other nation or sect; and it seems to
me that Peking Russian, and possibly Christian,
would be far better than Peking Chinese, and
certainly heathen. If further encroachment
were guarded against by Germany in Shantung
we should not be losers. Should France want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lii">[lii]</span>
a rectification of frontier for her great Asiatic
colony—why should we interfere? The restoration
of the old frontier of Burmah and the freedom
of the Yangtze region should suffice us.</p>

<p>As for a change of dynasty in China, which
some writers are crying for, that is an impossibility,
because there is no Chinese pretender
ready to replace the Manchus. It would mean
chaos such as the world has never seen.</p>

<p>Freed from the incubus of the Empress
Tsŭ Hsi and her eunuchs, freed from Prince
Tuan and the other bloodguilty Manchus, the
Emperor, surrounded by a more enlightened
court, and acting under capable advisers, would
be enabled to rule peacefully and honestly over
an immense and prosperous empire; while the
removal of the capital would, without any act
of vandalism, such as the suggested destruction
of the Tombs, read China that lesson which
is so sorely needed, and which the absurd reprisals
of 1860 utterly failed to convey. After
the second occupation of Peking we should not
again hear of the Barbarians bringing tribute
to the Son of Heaven from his vassals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_liii">[liii]</span></p>

<p>The idea of a change of capital is not one
that is of itself strange or repugnant to the
Chinese mind. It has even, apparently, been
contemplated by the Dowager-Empress herself,
though her choice would not unnaturally
fall upon a spot like Hsi An Fu, near which
town, at Hao, at Hsien Yang, and at Chang
An, the emperors of the Chou dynasty (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
1122–781), the Tsin (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 249–200), and the
Sui (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 582–904) held their courts. But the
chief charm of such a capital would be its inaccessibility
and remoteness from the haunts
of the foreign devil. Hsi An Fu would be
Peking over again, and worse. It would give
the <i lang="fr">coup de grâce</i> to all hope of civilising the
court.</p>

<p>In a letter published in the <i>Times</i> newspaper
of June 22 I advocated once more the choice of
Nanking as a new seat of Government, and I
said that such a change would be hailed with joy
by many millions of Chinese. A few days after
that letter appeared my arguments received
a very remarkable confirmation. A telegram
from Yokohama informed us that the Chinese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_liv">[liv]</span>
community in Japan, a highly intelligent,
educated, and respectable body of men, of
first-rate business capacity, had presented a
petition urging the foreign powers to take
advantage of the settlement which must follow
upon the present troubles, to insist upon the
removal of the capital from Peking to Nanking.
Now these men know what they are talking
about. They know that such a change would
work wonders in the direction of good government;
that it would take the power out of the
fossilised hands of the court; that the light of
day would be fatal to the bats and owls of the
forbidden city; that the secret societies would
be deprived of their chief support; that the
viceroys and the whole descending scale of
mandarins, brought under control of an intelligible
and intelligent Government, would no
longer be able to squeeze and persecute the
people, paralysing trade by their extortions
and blackmailing, and setting up insuperable
barriers to the progress of civilisation.</p>

<p>In the Blue Book published recently (July
30) we have the first instalment of the official<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lv">[lv]</span>
history of the tragedy of Peking—most melancholy
reading, truly! But there is one bright
spot in this miserable record. The attitude of
our Foreign Office in all the negotiations
which have taken place appears to have been
altogether admirable. In spite of the cold
water thrown by international jealousies upon
Lord Salisbury’s efforts to retrieve the situation,
he has held his own position, and he has
succeeded in using the best means which were
available without in any way compromising the
future. Japan is to furnish troops, but there
are no vague promises, no encouragement of
inordinate ambitions, and no raising of hopes,
which, if realised, might be fraught with dangers
beside which even the horrors of the last few
weeks would be as child’s play. Lord Salisbury
boldly promises to find the money, and
England will honour his bill. That is all. “Her
Majesty’s Government wish to draw a sharp
distinction between immediate operations which
may be still in time to save the Legations, and
any ulterior operations which may be undertaken.”
No language could be clearer or more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lvi">[lvi]</span>
satisfactory than this. Is it too much to hope
that when the final settlement comes, the
counsels of the same master-mind may devise
a solution which shall bring about a happier era
for China, without endangering the harmony
of those nations which are now united in their
resentment of outrages, for which the history
of the world finds no parallel?</p>

<p>Besides the Blue Book, recent events have
produced a plentiful crop of letters to the newspapers,
many of them written with great ability
and knowledge of Chinese affairs. The deposition
of the undoubtedly guilty Empress,
and the restoration to power of the Emperor,
with a Government composed of the progressive
party to which he is inclined, are with
most of the writers a <i lang="la">sine qua non</i>. To this
I say Amen. “The murderer Tuan must be
executed” is a favourite cry. By all means;
but we know what is the first postulate in the
cooking of a hare. Prince Tuan will hardly
be more easy to catch than was Nana Sahib
in 1857. If the Emperor, a weakling at best,
be left at Peking in a hotbed of harem intrigues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lvii">[lvii]</span>
and secret societies, how can he be protected?
Will his life be worth many days’ purchase?
Will a progressive ministry be able to exercise
any authority over the great provincial
satraps? The foreign representatives will be
locked up in the old death-trap, and in ten,
twenty, thirty years history will repeat itself.
The inviolable sanctity of Legations with such
surroundings becomes a most miserable farce.</p>

<p>The return to the <i lang="la">status quo ante</i>, with all
its possibility of tragic repetitions, is just the
sort of lame and impotent conclusion to which
we have accustomed the Chinese, and in their
dealings with us they count upon a moderation
which, like all Asiatics, they construe into fear,
and despise accordingly. A barren conquest
like that of 1860, which left things as they
were, is something which they cannot understand.
When Li Hung Chang, who knows
exactly what string it is best to harp upon,
sweetly urges us to arouse “the gratitude of
millions” by abstention from revenge, be sure
his gentle mind sees its way to turn such
magnanimity to good account. The horrors of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lviii">[lviii]</span>
to-day were begotten of the mistakes of 1860
and 1870. Let us hope that 1900 may be the
parent of a less ill-omened brood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Life</span> at sea may be a very pleasant one for
those who like it, but I doubt whether any one
ever arrived at the end of a voyage of a month
and a half by one of the P. and O. Co.’s

<p class="noindent">even Hong-kong is reached at last.</p>

<p>We rush up on deck after breakfast to see
the first of the brown, sun-scorched island. It
is shrouded in mist, however, and there is not
much to look at. But every one is excited and
flurried, and in the happiness of realising the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
luxury of being on land, we feel kindly
towards all mankind, and bid a cordial farewell
to our fellow-passengers. In a short
while we are in harbour, and the little colony,
planted at the foot of wild and rugged hills
matching those of the mainland opposite, lies
before us. A crowd of boats plying for hire,
and partly manned, to use a bull, by women
often pulling away lustily with a baby slung
across their backs, hail us with cries of “Wanchee
boat?” “Wanchee big boat?” These Chinese
boatwomen are real wonders. Hardy, strong,
and burnt by the sun, they look and probably
are as sturdy as any of the men. At any rate
I saw one woman fight and thrash a couple of
stalwart young boatmen; and a good stand-up
fight it was, give and take. They did not spare
her, and she belaboured them most lustily,
screaming and chattering all the while in a
way that would have frightened Billingsgate
itself into silence. The boats seem to hold
whole families,—even the nursery,—the small
boys wearing corks or bottles to keep them
afloat when they tumble overboard. The girls,
being reckoned of no value, take their chance,
and wear nothing to protect them. As soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
as we came to an anchor the boats of the great
commercial firms came alongside, each probably
steered by a partner eager to hear the latest
news or to welcome a friend. One by one the
passengers disappear, and he who has letters
for one of the merchant princes of China may
look forward to luxurious quarters and a warm
welcome, for nowhere else is hospitality carried
to such an extent as it is here.</p>

<p>The houses in Hong-kong are large and
airy. Lofty and spacious rooms not overloaded
with furniture (for everything is dispensed with
an eye to the getting the most air and coolness)
look out on to a broad verandah, which
is shaded with green rush blinds to keep out
the glare. Here bamboo lounging chairs, of
indescribable comfort, hold out arms that invite
one to doze away the sultry afternoon, or sit
smoking a cheroot and sipping cool drinks in
the most luxurious laziness. The clean and
neat matting on the floors, the rare curiosities
and jars which decorate the principal rooms,
the quiet, mouse-like steps of the China boys
in their blue dresses, who act as servants,
coming in to take an order or deliver a message
in their quaint pidgin English, give <span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>a
peculiar and original stamp to the whole, which
is of itself immensely refreshing. Everything
speaks of rest and quiet, and yet it is in these
quiet, idle-seeming houses—very castles of
Indolence they appear—that busy brains are
at work, toiling all day, calculating rises and
falls, watching chances by which thousands are
won or lost in a day. In the old days when
the opium trade was unlawful, and therefore at
its height, when the rival houses had each their
fast sailing clippers racing against one another
from Bombay and Calcutta, and the first to
arrive would lie hidden round the corner of the
bay, and send a man on shore across the hills
with the all-important intelligence, only showing
itself when a price had been made, the life of a
man of business at Hong-kong must have been
one of untold excitement. Nowadays every
man gets his letters by the mail, the opium
trade is legitimatised, and there is no longer
the same amount of “go” and dash about the
thing. Still, a venture of tea to the tune of
a million of dollars, upon which 40 or 50 per
cent may be made or lost, must be exciting
enough for most men. Just at present the
China trade is in a singularly bad way; vast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
sums have been lost in tea speculations; some
of the larger houses have been very hard hit,
but with plenty of capital at their backs have
stood the shock well. Smaller firms, however,
not having the same elasticity, have sunk under
it; smashes and rumours of smashes are rife;
and the only men who have not suffered are
those who, with wise prescience, have folded
their hands and done nothing, waiting for better
times.</p>

<p>Hong-kong presents perhaps one of the
oddest jumbles in the whole world. It is neither
fish, flesh, fowl, nor good red-herring. The
Government and principal people are English—the
population are Chinese—the police are
Indians—the language is bastard English
mixed with Cantonese—the currency is the
Mexican dollar, and the elements no more
amalgamate than the oil and vinegar in a
salad. The Europeans hate the Chinese,
and the latter return the compliment with
interest. In the streets Chinamen, Indian
policemen, Malays, Parsees, and half-castes
jostle up against Europeans, naval and military
officers, Jack-tars, soldiers, and loafers of all
denominations. Constantinople, Smyrna, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
Cairo show more picturesque and varied crowds,
but nothing can be more grotesque than the
street life of Hong-kong. The local cab is a
green chair<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> open in front and covered in at the
top, in which you may sit Yankeewise, with
your feet sprawling above your head, and be
carried along at a good pace by a couple of
strong-shouldered coolies with shaven polls,
long tails, and huge umbrella hats. Plenty of
these are waiting for hire at every corner.
They have a fixed tariff of ten cents the trip.
The weights that these coolies carry slung on
their bamboo-poles are something surprising.
I have seen Turkish hamals bent nearly double
under the most impossible loads, such as no
London railway porter would look at; but it
makes one’s shoulders ache to see the Chinamen
fetch and carry, for they do not hold the poles
in their hands with the support of a shoulder-strap,
like the chairmen who used to take old
ladies out to tea and scandal in English country
towns, but the bamboo poles are fastened at
the ends, and the men simply hoist them on to
their shoulders and stagger off under them.
Both men and women of the lower orders are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
certainly to our eyes mightily ill-favoured, and
have villainous countenances which, if all tales
be true, do not belie their characters; but now
and then one comes across a pretty creature
enough, some Cantonese, probably, as frail as
fair—for St. Antony is not generally worshipped
in seaside garrison towns. The long plaited
tails worn by the men, and eked out with silk
until they reach nearly to the heels, are a never-ending
source of wonder to the new-comer.
But there is one fashion of shaving the poll,
leaving here and there a hair like the bristles
on a gooseberry, which is peculiarly droll in
its effect—a “coiffure à la groseille.” The
Chinaman is very careful of his tail, and no cat
has a greater horror of wetting her coat than
he has of a drop of rain falling on his back hair.
To cut it off is the height of indignity; and
when the Chinese sailors on board the P. and
O. ships have been stealing opium from the
cargo, which they find it very hard to keep
their hands off, they are tied up by their tails
to the capstan and summarily flogged; in which
case they become useful as well as ornamental.
The barber drives a brisk trade; nor does he
confine himself to shaving, clipping, and plaiting;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
he has also cunning instruments with
which he cleans the eyes and ears of his clients,
the result of which is that the drums of their
ears are often injured, and the poor patients
afflicted with chronic deafness.</p>

<p>In this island of contrasts none is greater
than that between the European and Chinese
quarters of the town. In the former the
houses are large and well built of gray slate-coloured
bricks and fine granite, and others,
some of which will be real palaces, are in
course of construction. In the latter, on the
contrary, the houses are low and mean. They
are generally built with one story: on the
ground floor is the shop with its various goods
and quaint perpendicular inscriptions and advertisements;
on the first floor, which is thrown
out over the footway and supported by wooden
posts, so as to form a covered walk, the family
live, and here the ugly old women—uglier in
China than anywhere—and queer little yellow
children may be seen peering out of their dens
at the passers-by. Towards evening, when
the paper lanterns are lighted and the shops
are shut up, not by doors and shutters as with
us, but by a sort of cage of bamboo poles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
through which the interior is visible, the Chinese
house looks very fantastic and strange. This
quarter of the town bears a very bad name.
It swarms with houses of the worst repute, and
low grog-shops which are largely patronised by
the sailors. The coolies in the street are a
most ruffianly looking lot, not pleasant to meet
in a by-road alone and unarmed. Indeed, life
and property seem to be by no means so safe
in the colony as they should be, considering the
force which is kept here. A short time since
a gentleman was attacked in broad daylight in
the middle of the town, knocked down and
robbed; and it is downright dangerous to venture
on the hills alone without the moral
influence of a revolver. The Chinamen are
very clever thieves and housebreakers, and will
even venture into barracks, smuggle themselves
into the officers’ quarters, burn a little opium
under the nose of some sleeping hero, and in
double-quick time clear the room of watch,
chain, loose cash, and valuables. Sometimes,
however, they get caught. The other night
a young officer was too quick for one of these
light-fingered gentlemen, and pinned him just
as he was making off. A mighty pretty dressing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
he got too—for when the officers were tired
of thrashing him, with ingenious cruelty they
turned him into the lock-up where the drunken
soldiers were, and I leave you to guess what
sort of a night he spent. It is said that a
Hindoo will rob a man of the sheet he is sleeping
on without disturbing him, but I think to
clear the goods out of a large warehouse under
the owner’s nose, and with the police looking
on, is at least as great a feat. This happened
in this wise. A “godown” or storehouse full
of valuable goods was fixed upon, a number of
coolies walked in one fine day with a “comprador”
(headman, bailiff, steward, and factotum),
and with the utmost innocence set to
work emptying the place, the pretended comprador
all the while, in the most businesslike
manner, making notes of the bales which were
sent down to the quay and shipped off in small
boats. One coolie is so like another that no
wonder the policeman who was standing by
thought it was all right, and the very audacity of
the robbery put him off his guard. By the time
the theft was discovered, goods, coolies, and
comprador were well out of reach, and the owner
was left lamenting over his empty godown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span></p>

<p>It is rather hard on a man when he first
comes to these parts to have to learn a new
dialect of his own language more bizarre than
broad Somersetshire, more unintelligible than
that of Tennyson’s northern farmer. This is
the Cantonese or “pidgin” English. Pidgin
means business, of which word it is not difficult
to see that it is a corruption, and the jargon
is the <i lang="fr">patois</i> that has invented itself for transacting
affairs with the natives. Use a plain
English word to a Chinaman, and he will stare
and “no sabé”; but distort it, add a syllable
or two, put it in its wrong place, and, in short,
make it so unlike itself that its own root would
not acknowledge it, and he will catch your
meaning at once. Several Chinese, Portuguese,
and other words of doubtful pedigree, mixed
up with this maltreated English, make up the
lingo, which is a literal translation of Chinese
syntax, and puzzling enough at first. Here
is a specimen. I should tell you that in
pidgin bull is <i>male</i>, cow <i>female</i>. An
English gentleman from Shanghai went to
call at a friend’s house in Hong-kong. The
door was opened by the head Chinese boy.
“Mississee have got?” said the gentleman.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
“Have got,” answered the boy, “but just now
no can see.” “How fashion no can see?”
The boy answered, grinning from ear to ear,
“Last night have catchee one number one
piecee bull chilo!” The lady of the house had
been safely brought to bed during the night of
a fine baby boy! Sometimes the boy will dot
his I’s and cross his T’s with unfortunate distinctness
as to the occupations in which his master
or mistress is engaged, putting one in mind of
Gavarni’s <i lang="fr">Enfants Terribles</i>. It is not to be
wondered at that the coolies and servant boys
should talk this lingo, but that clever, intelligent
fellows like the compradors in big houses should
not have acquired a better form of English is
indeed strange.</p>

<p>Life at Hong-kong passes away pleasantly
enough. The residents are very rich, and
they spend their money like princes. Their
hospitality is boundless, and open house is the
rule. I can fancy no better quarters for a
naval or military man. The climate is very
different from what it used to be, and has
become very healthy; but if a man should fall
ill he can get away north to Peking, or run
up to Japan, or choose between a dozen trips<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
nearer at hand. The usual daily routine here
at this season of the year is as follows:—At
six your boy wakes you with a cup of tea; you
rise and bathe, and read or write till it is time
to dress for breakfast at twelve (the merchants,
of course, go to their offices at ten or even much
earlier). Breakfast, as it is called, is a regular
set meal with several courses, and champagne or
claret; any one comes in who pleases, and is sure
of a cordial welcome, and probably an invitation
to return to dinner. After a cup of coffee
and a cheroot, office work begins again, and
goes on until about five, when every one turns
out to ride, drive, or walk until seven, which
is the hour for gossip, and sherry and bitters
at the club, a first-rate establishment to which
strangers are admitted as visitors, and where
a man may put up if he pleases. Dinner is
at eight, and a very serious affair it is, for
Hong-kong is fond of good living and fine
vintages; and this rule does not apply only
to the heads of houses, for their clerks are
lodged and boarded exactly on the same scale
as themselves, and a boy who has been content
to dine for a shilling at a London chop-house,
sits down here to a dinner fit for a duke,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
criticises the champagne and claret with the
air of a connoisseur, and rattles in his pocket
£300 or £400 a year for his <i lang="fr">menus plaisirs</i>.
Which shows the superiority of vulgar fractions
to genteel Latin and Greek.</p>

<p>The rides and drives about Hong-kong are
in their way very pretty, though the almost
entire absence of trees presents a violent contrast
to the rich tropical vegetation of Singapore
and Penang. On the other hand, both
on the mainland and in the island itself,
there are bold, rugged mountain outlines, often
shrouded in a mist that reminds one of Scotland
and Ireland; huge boulders of rock from
which beautiful ferns of every variety (fifty-two
species have been classed) grow in profusion;
a bay studded with wild barren islands; and to
the east, where the colony is only separated
from the mainland by about a mile of sea, the
picturesque peninsula of Kowloon. The racecourse
in the Happy Valley is a lovely spot.
It is surrounded by hills on three sides, and
from the fourth, which is close to the bay, one
looks up a blue glen such as Sir Walter
Scott might have described. Here on the
slope of the hill is the cemetery, and here and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
at Government House there are some trees,
among which the graceful bamboo is conspicuous.
But it is the south-west of the
island that is most affected by the residents.
At a place called Pok Fo Lum, about four miles
off, several of the rich merchants have built
bungalows to which in summer-time, after
stewing all day in their offices, it is their wont
to resort of an afternoon, and let the fresh sea-breeze
clear their brains of tea, opium, silk,
rises and falls, and such-like cobwebs. On a
fine evening these gardens are a very pleasant
lounge. At the back rises the Peak, a fine
bold rock some 1700 feet high; all around are
sweet-scented tropical flowers teeming with
strange, many-coloured insects and gorgeous
butterflies; while in front the view stretches to
the mainland hills across the brilliant sea rippling
against little islands, and covered with
flotillas of native boats, peaceful enough to all
appearance, but ever ready for any little piece
of light piracy that may turn up.</p>

<p>I was very anxious before leaving the south
of China to see Canton, and accordingly on
the 28th April I started with a friend in one
of the huge house-steamers that ply between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
Hong-kong and Canton, and are of themselves
curiosities. They are divided into separate
parts for Europeans, Parsees, and natives of
the poorer class, with loose boxes into which
bettermost Chinese families are put. You may
form some idea of their size when I tell you
that three weeks ago, on the occasion of a
festival, our boat the <i>Kin Shan</i> took up 2063
Chinamen to Canton, whither they were bound
to “chin-chin” the graves of their ancestors.
In all American steamers—and this is a Yankee
venture—speed is the great object, and we
accomplished the distance, between 80 and
90 miles, under the six hours.</p>

<p>We had a bright sunny morning for our
expedition, and the harbour of Hong-kong
appeared to great advantage, for there were
plenty of fleecy clouds in the sky throwing
fantastic shadows over the hills around. The
sea was as calm and transparent as a lake,
and we could sit in the best cabin, which is
a huge building on the forecastle, catching
every breath of air, and enjoying the scenery.
The river-banks are at first wild, barren, and
hilly, like Hong-kong, but higher up there
begin to be signs of cultivation. Plantains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
and rice, which is the greenest of all green
grasses, grow in profusion among the snipe
marshes. Bamboos spring up close to the
water’s edge, and the hills are lower, less
savage-looking, and more fruitful. Ruined
forts, destroyed when we forced our trade
upon the unwilling Chinese, numberless boats
and junks, here and there a pagoda with
different sorts of plants peeping out of its
many stories, tell us that we are drawing near
a town, and after about four hours and a
half we reach Wampoa, a miserable place, with
about as dirty and degraded-looking a population
as could be seen anywhere. A few lime
kilns, soy or ketchup factories, and dry docks
where ships are brought to have their keels
cleaned of barnacles and sea-muck, seem to
constitute all the business of the place. I
shall always henceforth look upon soy as the
essence of the dirt of Wampoa.</p>

<p>Canton itself does not present a very clean
face to be washed by the unsavoury river. If
any one should come here expecting to see a
fine city of quays and palaces, he will be
grievously disappointed. Myriads of low dirty
wooden houses, built almost in the very water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
itself, are crowded together higgledy piggledy,
without order or method. As if these were not
enough, there are whole streets, alleys, and
quarters of the foulest boat-houses, all swarming
with human, and probably other, life. Junks in
numbers, carrying guns for defence, and if a
safe opportunity occurs, for offence, are moored
in the stream. Strange, grotesque craft they
are, with their huge bows built to represent the
heads of sea-monsters; a great eye is painted
on each side, for the Chinese treat their ships
as reasoning beings, and say, “S’pose no got eye,
no can see; s’pose no can see, no can walkee,”
which is unanswerable—even the <i>Kin Shan</i>
carries an eye on each paddle-box in deference
to this idea. But as at Hong-kong, the chief
peculiarity of the river scene here is the crowd
of small boats with female crews. The mother
pulls the stroke oar, the aunt the bow, and
grandmamma is at the helm with a third. I am
sure there must have been several hundreds of
these yellow ladies round the steamer at one
time. The parrot-house at the Zoological
Gardens was silence itself by comparison, for
hard work, and strong pulling, have given them
lungs of leather. They all claim acquaintance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
and employment on the strength of it. “My
boatee, my boatee, my no see you Cheena side
long tim.” We had our own boat, however, and
with patience cleared a way and got to shore.
But no description of the Canton River would
be complete without an allusion to the famous
“flower-boats.” Huge, unwieldy barges they
are, moored by the river-side, and tricked out
with every paltry decoration of cheap gilding,
paper lanterns, and bizarre ornament that the
Owen Jones of China can invent. These are
the temples of Venus. The priestesses are
mostly brown ugly little women in sad-coloured
garments, upon whose flat yellow faces the
rosy paint looks even more ghastly than on
Europeans; some are almost pretty, however,
and all have beautiful hands and feet (when the
latter have not been wantonly deformed), indeed
this is the one gift of beauty common to all the
Chinese, and the very men-servants who wait
upon one have hands kept delicately clean, and
so well formed that many an European lady
might envy them; they have no need to wrap
a napkin round their thumbs, nor to wear white
cotton gloves; their taper fingers and filbert
nails are pleasant to look upon. At night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
when the lanterns are lighted, and the tawdriness
of the decorations is less offensive, the
flower-boats look gay enough, and they are
one of the sights of Canton. The trade that
their denizens ply is not looked upon as disgraceful,
nor does it prevent their marrying
respectably afterwards,—at least so it is said.</p>

<p>We had had an empty house placed at our
disposal, and we took with us a servant, a coolie,
and a native cook. And this brings me to the
record of a feat. When we arrived at our house
we found that the boy in charge (a “boy,” like
the boy in Oliver Twist, may be a very old man)
had gone off to “chin-chin” his ancestors’ graves,
a ceremony which, although our coming had
been announced to him, could on no account be
deferred. So there we were at half-past three,
without so much as a scrap of fuel or a gridiron
to put upon it. In spite of this we sat
down, four of us, at eight o’clock, to a dinner of
mulligatawny soup, soles, for which the river is
famous, three <i lang="fr">entrées</i>, a buffalo’s hump, like
boiled beef idealised, snipes, curried prawns, and
a dessert of plantains, oranges, rose apples,
tasting just like rose leaves, and dried lychees,
the whole being decked out in the most excellent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
taste, with a profusion of the sweetest scented
and most brilliant flowers. We had our wine
with us, and altogether I never sat down to a
better dinner. Could any English servants,
arriving at an empty house in London, have
done the same? The Chinese, when they have
learnt to cook after our fashion, are the best
<i>chefs</i> in the world. You see the art requires
delicacy of hand, plenty of imagination, and does
not involve a knowledge of perspective, so it
just suits their talents.</p>

<p>I am afraid I can give you but a poor
description of Canton; the inventory is too
large to be taken in a letter. Mr. Sala or any
of the professed literary appraisers would find
matter for at least a chapter in the bad smells.
The streets are very narrow. Three men
might walk abreast in them, and perhaps you
might throw in a boy if he was very tiny indeed.
On each side are small, low shops,
which throw out such a multitude of lanterns
and perpendicular notices, like the attenuated
ghosts of many-coloured banners, that they
look as if a solemn procession in a pantomime
had been changed by a tap of the harlequin’s
wand into a scene of streets and advertisements.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
As if the gangway were not narrow
enough, hucksters and costermongers, offering
every kind of goods for sale, hold their stalls
on each available square foot of pavement.
There are meat stalls, fruit stalls, sweetmeat
stalls, sugar-cane stalls, fish stalls, and what
can only be designated as offal stalls. The
yellowest crowd in the world hustles along
pell-mell at a furious rate, for every one is busy
and every one is in a hurry. Coolies carrying
every conceivable burden balance-wise, from a
load of timber to a bundle of leeks, rush at one,
and it needs a sharp look-out to steer clear of
their bamboo poles. Round the corner, lolling
in his chair, for all the world like one of those
“magots” Frenchwomen are so fond of, a
Chinese dignitary is borne along, attended by
five or six policemen in white caps and red tassels,
nearly upsetting a small-footed lady, who has
just time to totter out of the way on her rickety
legs. If there is a clear space, you may be
sure there is a doctor or fortune-teller peering
into his patient’s mouth, like a groom examining
a horse’s teeth, or tapping his head mysteriously
with a fan, to the wonder of a small
gaping circle. Barring in very rare instances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
a dog or two—for the wary little beasts seem
to know the danger that they run of being
turned into butchers’ meat if they stray out of
their own domain—no animals are to be seen.
Beasts of burden are represented by the men,
and beasts of draught there are none; indeed,
no carriage, cart, or costermonger’s barrow could
thread its way here. The amount of industry to
be seen in a single street is something surprising.
Carpenters, cobblers, turners, carvers—artisans,
in short, of all guilds, are toiling away for dear
life—no one is idle. The butcher is busy
separating the coarser from the finer parts of
the meat; the fishmonger gutting his fish,
and setting the entrails carefully on one side—there
is no part too vile or mean, none too
dear and delicate to find a customer. Chow-chow
dogs (I saw such a pretty little puppy
being carried off to execution; he looked like
a brown spitz, and I felt inclined to buy his
release), birds’ nests, rice-birds, the beccafichi
of China, and all manner of delicacies, are
cheek-by-jowl with equally numerous abominations,
not to speak of rats and “such small
deer.” The greengrocers’ are the most tempting
of the provision shops; they at least <span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>show
nothing offensive, and they make their fruit
look to the greatest advantage, setting oranges,
apples, lychees, and vegetables in curious patterns,
while ropes of bananas, leeks, young
lettuces, and other greens hang from the ceiling.
Competition is great, and with the utmost
labour it is hard to earn a living, for the two
cities, Tartar and Chinese, with their suburbs,
hold an immense population, not to speak of
the thousands who are born, live, and die in
the boats, and have no part or share in the
land until they come in for that property six
feet by three, which is the common inheritance.
Altogether, taking both sides of the river, there
are probably a million and a half of inhabitants,
of whom not more than one hundred are
Europeans.</p>

<p>Until the return of the English to Canton,
it used to be a point of honour with the Chinese
at Hong-kong to try and persuade people that
the bombardment of 1856 had not done much
damage. If they were asked whether Yeh’s
Palace or Yamên had been injured they would
answer, “Not too muchee; my hab hear they
breakee that cup that saucer; that alloo.” But
the fact is that the city still bears the marks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span> of
the punishment it received; considerable spaces
have been laid waste by fire; Yeh’s Yamên
has been razed to the ground and its site “annexed”
by the French, who are building a
cathedral and Jesuit college upon it. Notwithstanding
the havoc made by shot and shell,
however, there is much to be seen. The
Yamêns of the Viceroy, the Governor, and
other high functionaries are standing. I only
saw the outsides of these palaces. They are
all pretty much alike. An arched gateway,
with a colossal warrior painted in fresco on
either side, faces a blank wall, on which is drawn
the outline of some fabulous monster, and this
appears to be used for notices and announcements;
marble kylins and grotesque beasts
adorn the courtyard, which is crowded with
functionaries and dependants. The roofs are
fretted into a thousand quaint designs; but you
are as familiar with their style as I am, and as
I shall probably in some future letter have an
opportunity of saying something about the
interior of a Chinese officer’s palace, I had
better let the subject alone now.</p>

<p>Of course we went to see the “Temple of
Punishments” and that of the Five Hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
Saints, which last is one of the celebrities of
China. The former is so called from its containing
models of all the various modes which
Chinese ingenuity has invented for torturing
malefactors. Guarding the portals are two
colossal “josses” or idols, represented with
vermilion faces and a prodigious corpulency.
Bits of paper, as votive offerings, some with
inscriptions, but more without, are pinned or
fastened to them by the pious: this is a Chinese
method of showing respect to the graves of
their dead, and to their gods. Inside the gate
is a large courtyard, which we found crowded
with people; all around were little tables at
which sat fortune-tellers, some young men,
others veterans with scanty beards and enormous
tortoise-shell spectacles, writing as solemnly as
judges. Here in bamboo divisions are the
dolls which give the temple its name, and very
horrible are the scenes which they represent;
beyond the courtyard is the real joss-house,
from which I carried away a confused idea of
tinsel, artificial flowers, scraps of paper, and
gloom.</p>

<p>Far more interesting was the Temple of the
Five Hundred Saints. In the gateway, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span> in
the former case, two josses of stupendous size
mount guard. One is represented as solacing
himself with a tune on a kind of mandoline;
and I noticed that many of the scraps of paper
with which he has been “chin-chinned” were
cut in the shape of his favourite instrument.
Without let or hindrance we wandered through
a maze of white-washed and neatly-kept cloisters,
until we came to the refectory (for there
is a monastery attached to this temple), where
we found the monks at their afternoon meal.
Just as we arrived, a tiny musical-toned bell
was sounded, at which signal the brethren rose,
and what appeared to be a short prayer or
grace was recited in chorus, after which a
monk of higher rank, preceded by an attendant,
left the hall, which was a square room with
long tables, and fenced off from the cloisters at
one end by a low bamboo railing. As soon as
the great man was gone the others fell to at
their chopsticks and small bowls with renewed
vigour. The monks wear a long light gray
robe, and they shave the whole head, but
in other respects their dress does not differ
from that of laymen. The temple itself is a
large hall in which the five hundred, placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
in alleys at right angles, sit facing one another
in all their majesty. They are all of gilt metal
or wood, and under life size, if one may use
such a term with regard to idols. They are
represented in every variety of attitude, occupation,
and expression. Some are playing on
musical instruments, and are bland; others are
evidently preaching, and are didactic; others
are inflicting punishment or doing battle, and
are very fierce; one is performing a difficult act
of horsemanship on a large kylin, while two
smaller kylins are looking on in admiration—one
and all are made to look fat and comfortable,
with huge paunches. Before each is
placed a small green porcelain pot filled with
the ashes of the joss-sticks which have been
burnt in his honour. The monks were uniformly
civil to us, and neither here nor in
the Temple of Horrors was any fee asked or
expected; how much better it would be if
Europeans would follow the example of these
heathens, and not ask admission fees in their
cathedrals and churches.</p>

<p>You may well imagine that during a first
visit to a great Chinese city everything appeared
strange and marvellous, but the greatest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
wonder of all was that we should be able
to wander hither and thither, intruding into
temples, thrusting our curious noses into every
hole and corner, like ferrets in a rabbit warren,
elbowing our way unmolested through crowds
that a very few years ago would have mobbed
and brick-batted at least, and perhaps tortured
and murdered by inches, any European that
ventured outside the factories. It seems almost
a fatality that now that the city is safe, and its
inhabitants peacefully inclined, the opening of
the Yang-Tse-Chiang should have turned the
European traffic with the interior, of which
Canton was formerly the headquarters, into a
new channel. The prosperity of Canton is evident,
and very striking. But it is a native and
self-containing prosperity, and in no ways dependent
on Europe, and shows that the Chinese
were quite right when they asserted that they
could do very well without us. Just before the
principal English firms withdrew their representatives
from the city, finding that the little
business there was to do could be more cheaply
transacted by agents drawing a small percentage,
an arrangement was made with the local
government whereby we became the lessees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span> of
a small mud island, which had to be filled in
at a great cost, called Shah-Meen. This was
to become the English quarter. The church
and new consular buildings have been erected
there, and there are a few empty bungalows
belonging to merchants, but the place does
not seem likely ever to wear a look of great
importance; the merchants see no likelihood
of an inducement to return, so Shah-Meen has
so far been a poor bargain.</p>

<p>Not far from Shah-Meen are the pleasure-gardens
of a merchant named Po-Ting-Qua.
Terraces, summer-houses, stairs, drawbridges,
carp-ponds, rock-work, and flowers are thrown
together most fantastically, exactly like the
gardens that the ladies and gentlemen on teacups
and plates walk about in. The doors are
cut out of the walls in quaint shapes, such as
circles, jars, bottles, etc. As the rainy season
has set in the garden was not looking its best,
but it was very pretty nevertheless, although
there was a little too much stagnant water
about for our ideas. Lord Bacon in his essay
on gardens says: “For fountains they are a
great beauty and refreshment; but pools mar
all and make the garden unwholesome, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span> full
of flies and frogs.” If this is true in England,
how much more does it apply to the East.
Such things as flower-beds are unknown here.
The plants grow anyhow, without order or
arrangement, but they are carefully tended, and
indeed the whole place was beautifully kept, and
there seemed to be a large staff of gardeners
and carpenters, who play a conspicuous part in
a Chinese garden.</p>

<p>You will be wanting to hear about the
curiosity shops. I went to see them, but found
nothing but rubbish at outrageous prices. The
Chinese buy up everything good at any price.
The dealers carry round their best things to
the native connoisseurs, and put off any trash
upon chance customers, swearing that everything
is “oloo and culew,” old and curious. I
bought one small bottle for a few shillings as a
souvenir of Canton, but even if I had had
heaps of money, there was no temptation to
spend it. I found an old friend at Canton in
the person of Mr. R., our consul, who was a
most amiable cicerone. He has passed the
chief part of his life in China, and is a great
authority upon all matters connected with our
relations with the Chinese. He lives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span> in a
fascinatingly picturesque Yamên with quite an
extensive garden—a curiosity in itself,—we
spent most of the day together and met for
dinner, either at my quarters or in his beautiful
Aladdin’s palace, every evening.</p>

<p>We returned to Hong-kong on May Day. I
found that the P. and O. Co. had put on an
extra steamer, to start on Thursday the 4th, so I
determined not to wait for the mail, but to start
for Shanghai without delay. This prevents me
from making a trip to Macao, which is par
excellence <i>the</i> “outing” from Hong-kong.
But as the rainy season has begun in earnest,
perhaps I do not lose much—at any rate, I
shall leave my Hong-kong friends with the
utmost regret; their kindness and hospitality
have known no bounds.</p>

<span class="smcap">Shanghai</span>, <i>10th May 1865</i>.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Ganges</i> did not leave Hong-kong until
the 5th at noon, and we anchored off the lightship
in the estuary here on Monday night, but
the river is so difficult of navigation that we
could not run into Shanghai until the next
morning. We had on the whole a fine
passage and a very quick one; C. and R.,
who were my companions at Canton, came
on with me, and the captain of the ship
being a very well-read, gentlemanlike man,
sparing no pains to make every one comfortable,
we had a very cheery voyage. We had
besides a young French artillery officer on his
way to revisit the scene of the campaign he
had made in 1860, a few nondescripts, two or
three Chinese families, and a Parsee. Of course
the Chinamen pigged together separately, and
his “odium theologicum” forbade the Parsee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
to eat with us, which was a benefit to all
parties, for he was not a desirable companion
by any means. The point of dirt at which the
Chinese passengers contrived to arrive during
the voyage, and the whiffs which came from
their cabins when the doors were opened, surpass
belief; one of their great gentlemen here
stood over the French officer and myself as we
were playing backgammon one day, and manifested
the utmost interest in the game, uttering
exclamations at every lucky throw, for the
Chinese are gamblers to the backbone,—but so
noisome was he that we had to leave off playing
and rush on deck for fresh air. This being
the condition of a “gentleman,” fancy how
pleasant the 110 coolie passengers under the
forecastle were to sight and smell. The Chinese
ladies did not show at all, but they used to send
their dirty little brats up on deck to play, and
very offensive they contrived to make their
small selves. Independently of their dirt,
Chinamen are a sorry spectacle on a journey—their
heads require shaving (a week’s crop looks
even worse on the poll than on the chin), and
their tails get untidy and shaggy from being
slept upon. Talking of tails, it seems <span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>to be
the “chic” at Shanghai to lengthen them with
white instead of black silk, which does not look
near so well. I noticed one man who, like
little Cock Robin, had “tied up his tail with a
yard of blue bobbin.” (I found out afterwards
that these white and blue tails are signs of
mourning.)</p>

<p>The voyage from Hong-kong to the north,
being principally a coasting affair, is not so
dull and uneventful as more sea-going cruises.
We were constantly in sight of land—numberless
headlands and islands mark the course, but
render it dangerous in bad weather. There
are plenty of ships to be seen, and all around
the rocky islands the sea is alive with fishing-smacks,
their crews busily at work. We had no
mails on board, nor stern officers in charge, so
the captain stopped once and bought a quantity
of fresh fish, delicious pomfret all alive and
kicking, paying the fishermen in kind with
ship’s biscuit, which I hope was as great a
boon to them as their fish was to us. It is
such a fine sight in one of these narrow island
passages, where one can almost hear the sea
dashing against the basaltic rocks on either
side, to pass a great sailing-ship close on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span> our
lee, and steam away from her at top speed.
Long before the estuary is reached, the sea,
which in these parts is of a deep aquamarine
green, becomes clouded and discoloured. This
is owing to the immense volume of yellow dirty
water which the Yang-tse-kiang pours down.
It is much the same colour as the Rhine, and
quite as foul-looking.</p>

<p>We began ascending the river soon after
daybreak on Tuesday morning. Its banks are
low and flat. If it were not for a few trees
there would be nothing to relieve the eye from
the monotony of the filthy water and vast
plain. Here and there a group of European
houses and an ensign or two mark a settlement.
By eleven o’clock we had threaded our way
through the labyrinth of shipping and had
reached Shanghai. I landed at once and heard
of an opportunity for Tientsing on Friday next,
of which I shall avail myself. By the way, I
must tell you here, that so far as I can learn,
the communications between Tientsing and this
place are somewhat uncertain, so if any mail
should not carry a letter to you from me, do
not pay me the compliment of being uneasy,
but let no news be good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span> news.</p>

<p>My good quarters and the kind hospitality
which I had met with at Hong-kong seem to
follow me on my travels. Here again I have
been received with the warmest welcome by
Mr. D., a junior partner of C.’s, and I am
assured of the same at Tientsing. If all the
travellers and officers stationed in China,
whom I have met, did not tell me that this
hospitality is the universal rule, I should
be almost shy of accepting so much kindness.</p>

<p>I have little enough to tell you about
Shanghai. The city is ugly and unattractive,
the river dingy, and the country a dead level
plain. From the top of the club-house the
view in every direction is utterly unbroken,
there is not a mound the height of dear old
Salt Hill. Then, commercially speaking, the
town at the time of my visit was a blank.
The crisis of which I have spoken to you
before has told here more than elsewhere;
to my eye the harbour seems full enough of
shipping, but I am told that there are not
more than a third of the vessels that used
to be seen in former years. One of the
causes which has brought about this effect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span> has
been the speculation in land. When the rebellion
panic was upon the Chinese they were
only too glad to flock into the settlement for
shelter; land rose in value, and was bought up
in every direction. Now that the revolt has
been put down in this part of the empire the
natives have gone home to their own abodes,
and of course landed property has fallen, so
that those speculators who did not sell in time
have their money hopelessly tied up. This,
and the competition system practised by the
Europeans in contrast to the Chinese, who do
everything by combination, together with “hard
times,” have brought Shanghai very low. In
short, morally as well as physically, it is, for the
present, flat.</p>

<p>I have had a good deal of conversation with
Sir Harry Parkes, our consul here. You will
recollect him as famous for the pluck he showed
when he and Loch were taken prisoners in
Peking; he is one of the great authorities in
China, and one of our ablest officers in the
East. He tells me that he considers the state
of feeling between the Chinese and Europeans
in this part as on the whole satisfactory; that
the natives have begun to accept us and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span> our
trade as a necessity; to use his own expression,
it is a sort of husband and wife arrangement,
with slight incompatibilities of temper
on both sides. Sir Harry Parkes is a man of
extraordinary determination and energy; his
knowledge of the Chinese language, customs,
and character have given him an immense
influence over the natives. He is in every
way a remarkable man, and great things
are expected of him, even by those who
differ from him in opinion. It is only fair
to say, that there are many men of judgment
and experience out here who do not agree
with him in holding that our trade with
China stands on a solid footing. They consider
that the unwilling spirit with which the
natives first received us has by no means died
out, and that little by little, always by fair
means and without violence,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> for they know
our strength, the Chinese will endeavour to
oust us from our position, and return to their
traditional conservatism. Perhaps this is a
pessimist creed, but still it is largely professed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
At any rate the Chinese will find it a hard
matter to get rid of us, for no Government
will give up a matter of nearly six millions of
revenue without a struggle. For the present
the British are welcome here. The Ta̔i Pi̔ngs
have been driven out of this part of China, and
the rebellion has dwindled down to comparative
unimportance. The Chinese may be
given credit for so much of gratitude as looks
upon past benefits as earnests of future favours.
We can still be useful, so we are still courted.
It remains to be seen whether, when we shall
have played our part out, our friends will try
to cast us on one side.</p>

<p>When Sir Rutherford Alcock was in
authority here he established a municipal
system which so long as Shanghai was prosperous
answered very well; of course, however,
this being Chinese territory, subscription
to the authority of the municipality could not
be compulsory, nor were its enactments binding;
but it suited the interests of the public
to accept it, and so it was supported by all the
respectable part of the community. Now the
failures have told upon this as upon every
other institution, and unless better times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span> come,
it will fall to the ground for want of funds and
strength. It would be a great pity that this
should be the case, for there are many improvements
needed here; above all, gas-lighting. It
is really to be hoped that things will take a
better turn soon, for they seem to be quite at
their worst.</p>

<p>I must tell you of rather a funny offer of
service that I received the other day. R.’s
Chinese boy came into me, and after playing
nervously with his tail for a little while, said,
“My massa talkee my too muchee fooloo; my
thinkee more better my walkee Peking side
long you.” I felt half-inclined to engage the
man for his simplicity, especially as he is
a good servant, though certainly not over
bright.</p>

<i>11th May.</i>
</p>

<p>I have just been to see my berth on board
the <i>Yuen-tse-Fee</i>, a private steamer. She is to
stop at Chihfu. I have a cabin to myself, a
piece of good luck which I have enjoyed ever
since Galle. In about a week hence I expect
to be at Peking. We sail at three in the
morning to-morrow, so I must go on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span> board
this evening. The <i>Yuen-tse-Fee</i> is a very tiny
craft; nothing big can get up the Peiho, so if it
blows at all shan’t we just pitch about!</p>

<p>We are expecting the mail in hourly, but I
hope to reach Peking before it.</p>

In the Gulf of Pechili,<br>
<i>15th May 1865</i>.&emsp;
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I daresay</span> you will understand that I was
rather melancholy at leaving Shanghai. For
the first time on all this long journey I was to
set out alone, and my hosts, although they
were only recent acquaintances, had been so
kind to me that I felt as if I were leaving old
friends. I took leave of them at half-past
eleven on Thursday night, 11th May, for as
the ship was to sail at three in the morning I
had to sleep on board. The harbour was dark
and gloomy, and it was as much as I could do
to steer the six-oared gig by the dim light of
the lanterns at the various masts’ heads. In
short, everything looked black and dismal, and
I felt very much like going back to school
after the holidays; but it don’t do to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span> in,
and very soon after I got on board I was
sleeping as sound as the rats in my cabin and
bed, and an army of mosquitoes which had
flocked on board, would let me. When I
woke next morning we were hard and fast
aground in the estuary; a thick fog had come
on in the night, and the captain, missing his
course, had run upon one of the many
treacherous shoals of the great river. The
tide took us off again at about eleven, and we
went on without further accident.</p>

<p>I had one fellow-passenger, an officer of the
purveyor’s department of the army, on his road
to Peking to seek employment under the Imperial
Government.</p>

<p>We had a strong head wind against us at
first and very dirty weather on Friday night.
But in spite of wind and weather the little
<i>Yuen-tse-Fee</i> justified her name, which a Chinaman
interpreted for me as “walkee all the
same Fly,” and she kept up a good average of
eight knots and a half.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning we were off the
Shantung promontory, a fine broad headland
with a rough, jagged outline. Notwithstanding
the haziness of the atmosphere we had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span> a good
view of the coast and of the Rocky Islands
which make this sea so dangerous. Passing
Cape Cod, we left to the westward the spot
where the unlucky <i>Race Horse</i> was lost, and
arrived at Chihfu at about five o’clock the same
evening.</p>

<p>For a town which really has some little
commercial importance, Chihfu is certainly one
of the most wretched dens I ever saw. It
consists of one long narrow street of untidy
stone and brick houses, the peculiarity of which
is that they have no apparent front or back, so
that it is a mystery how the inhabitants get
into or out of them. Two or three European
houses, the office of the Chinese officer of
Customs, a few godowns more or less empty,
and here and there a hovel built up of mud, seaweed,
and bamboo matting, complete the town.
Its only ornaments are the flags of the consul
and of the Chinese officer. It is prettily
situated at the foot of a range of low, but
picturesquely tossed-about hills, and the harbour
with its fleet of junks and ships looks very well
from the town. The type of the inhabitants is
different from that of the southern Chinese, the
Tartar features are very prominent among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span> them,
and it seemed to me that they were stronger
and finer men. I certainly never saw a better
boat’s crew than the six men who rowed me on
shore. Whether they would have the pluck to
“stay” against an English crew I cannot say,
but their short spurt was admirable.</p>

<p>In spite of its mean appearance there is
sufficient trade carried on at Chihfu to induce
some seventy Europeans to reside there. It
is, moreover, likely to become popular as a
sea-bathing resort and sanatorium.</p>

<p>In former days it was a great port for the
junks, and there are still many of them
running there; but the junk trade has been
very much knocked on the head by foreign
ships and steamers, which the Chinese see the
advantage of chartering, although they continue
to build their own clumsy and unwieldy craft.
The principal exports of Chihfu are peas and
bean cake, and a little manufactured silk; there
is besides a small import trade of shirtings and
opium.</p>


<p class="right-indent p2">
<i>17th May.</i>
</p>

<p>The best part of Monday was occupied in
discharging our cargo, and we did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span> get up
steam until five o’clock. A strong wind had
sprung up from the north-west, and the harbour,
which is very much exposed on that side, gave
signs and tokens which led us to expect a very
squally night outside; however, the wind
dropped suddenly and gave place to a thick fog,
so we escaped being tossed about, at the
expense of a few alarms of running on to the
rocks; which is not at all a pleasant look-out,
for even if our lives would not have been in
actual danger, there was the certainty that if
we had struck a rock we should have lost all
our baggage, and passed a very uncomfortable
night. We took up another passenger at
Chihfu, an interpreter, bound for Tientsing—apparently
a very popular gentleman, for the
captain had to turn out neck and crop a company
of friends who had come to see him off,
and who were inclined to prolong that ceremony,
which involves much sherry and brandy drinking,
until long past the hour fixed for our
departure.</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning we took up our pilot
for the Peiho River. He reported having
come across a junk wrecked and without masts—all
hands had evidently been lost;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span> and on
fishing about the cabin with a boat-hook in
order to get the papers if possible, he found two
or three dead bodies in a fearful state of decomposition.
It is supposed that she must have
been wrecked more than a month ago.</p>

<p>We are absolutely suffering from cold here.
The thermometer is 55° in my cabin—a serious
contrast after the 90° and 95° I have been
accustomed to. My warmer clothes are in the
hold, so I am forced to wear a greatcoat. We
expect to find it warmer at Tientsing.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon on Tuesday
when we arrived at the entrance of the River
Peiho.</p>

<p>Here are the famous Taku Forts, the scene
of the disaster of 1859, when Sir Frederick
Bruce went up to get the treaty ratified, and
our vessels were beaten back with the loss of
two gunboats, which were sunk. The two
forts stand on either side of the mouth of the
river, and are occupied—that on the north by
the French, and that on the south by the
English. A company of infantry suffices to
garrison each. They are about to be evacuated.
A little to the east of the British Fort there
still lies one of our sunken gunboats;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span> the
Chinese have recovered and appropriated her
guns. I cannot conceive a more dismal lot
than that of garrisoning Taku. Besides the
forts, which in themselves are dreary enough,
there are but a few Chinese mud huts and an
hotel, principally patronised by pilots; and the
French are cut off even from these by the
Peiho, than which no more filthy little stream
ever defiled a sea. Its banks at the mouth are
vast plains of mud, lying flush with the water,
and so bleak and sad-looking that one almost
wonders that the very wild-fowl should be
induced to stop there. Mud forts, mud houses,
mud fields, and muddy river—everything is
mud.</p>

<p>Higher up stream, although the banks are
very flat and uninteresting, there is no lack of
verdure. The trees are insignificant, but there
are green fields and gardens cultivated with
vegetables and fruit-trees. The neighbourhood
of Tientsing is said to be the garden of China,
and in the season a peach only fetches three
cash, of which one thousand or more, according
to the exchange, go to make up the dollar.</p>

<p>We soon had an experience of the difficulty
of navigating the Peiho, which is no <span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>broader
than the Thames at Eton, and as tortuous as
Cuckoo weir. Over and over again we were
on the point of running aground, and when on
one occasion we did stick, it was a labour of
great difficulty to get off again. A boat’s crew
had to be landed, and a line fastened to a stout
tree on the bank, by which means and by backing
with all our force we floated off, the sailors
on shore improving the occasion by stealing
onions and vegetables from the gardens on the
bank. Nor was the shallowness of the water
our only impediment, for we did not reach
Tientsing without several brushes and collisions
with junks, in one of which our screw was
broken.</p>

<p>I found Tientsing in a great state of excitement.
It was the last day of the races, and to
my great joy I found my colleague Saurin
staying at the Russian consulate. Of course
we agreed to make the journey to Peking
together, and the Russian consul, by way of
making things pleasant, most kindly volunteered
to put me up.</p>

<p>The races really showed some very good
sport. Tientsing cannot boast of such a meeting
as those of Hong-kong and Shanghai,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
where English thoroughbreds are run, and for
which such horses as “Buckstone,” since dead,
and “Sir William” are imported; the horses are
but Mongol ponies, the <i lang="la">bona fide</i> hacks of their
owners and riders, yet they accomplished the
three-mile race in seven minutes and forty
seconds. They are very plucky, strong little
beasts, and run till they drop. The races were
an additional stroke of luck for me, for I was
able at the end of the day to buy a capital pony
for fifty dollars. The Chinese crowd showed
the greatest possible interest in all the proceedings,
and the course had to be kept <i lang="la">vi et
flagellis</i>, which latter were not spared by the
native police. Perhaps they feared spoiling the
Chinaman, who is proverbially a child.</p>

<p class="right-indent p2">
<i>19th May.</i>
</p>

<p>I must own that I was agreeably disappointed
in Tientsing. So many travellers have abused it,
and inveighed against its filth and its beggarly
crowd, that I expected to be shocked in one or
other of my senses at every step. It certainly
is very dirty, but not much more so than other
Chinese towns, or, for that matter, than many
in Europe; and who that has travelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span> in the
sunny South has not seen rags and tatters,
vermin, foul diseases, and deformities paraded
as stimulants to charity? There is one drawback
to Tientsing which is really insufferable.
All the wells are salt, and the inhabitants are
obliged to drink the loathsome water of the
river. In order to cleanse it, it is first placed
in large jars that the impurities may settle at
the bottom, and then filtered. But nothing can
purge it so as to convince one that the disgusting
matter, which forces itself upon one as
one sails up the stream, has been entirely got
rid of.</p>

<p>We went to see some of the curiosity shops.
There was a great deal of porcelain to which
the dealers and local connoisseurs assigned wonderful
dates and fine titles, but nothing that
would be cared for in England; and the prices
were simply outrageous, for the merchants will
pay any mad sum that is asked by the rascally
dealers. There were some very fine specimens
of cloisonné enamel, but if the sums demanded
for the porcelain were high, the enamels were
ten times dearer. I saw a quantity of Chinese
picture-books; they were not fit to buy, although
some had great merit for delicacy of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>drawing.
They each represented a story, generally the
“Harlot’s Progress,” from a Chinese point of
view, very coarse, and without Hogarth’s grim
retribution at the end. Of course, where such
drawings are openly exposed for sale there is
no great strictness of morals, and Tientsing is
famous, or rather infamous, even in China, for
every bestial and degrading vice.</p>

<p>The European settlement of Tientsing is
about two miles distant from the Chinese city.
There are some fairly good houses built by the
side of a broad bund or quay, and they command
fabulous rents. The same municipal
system which obtains at Shanghai has been
established here; and, on the whole, the community
shows signs of prosperity, although the
port has been a disappointment to those who
expected that it would reach an importance
such as to crush Shanghai and its other rivals,
or, at all events, to divert a considerable portion
of their trade. For the first year or two
after its establishment the business done was
very great, and large fortunes were made; one
merchant, for example, is just retiring with a
fortune of £5000 a year, accumulated since
1861. But the Chinese, cunning in trade,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span> very
soon found out that it answered their purpose
better to charter steamers, and have consignments
made to themselves directly, than to buy
from the agents of the great houses; consequently,
as the trade is entirely import, the
Europeans are finding less and less to do. The
<i>Yuen-tse-Fee</i>, although she hails from Glasgow,
and is nominally owned by Messrs. Trautmann
and Co., a German firm, is in reality chiefly,
if not entirely, the property of a dirty little
Chinese comprador, whom I saw, and to whom
the whole of her cargo was consigned.</p>

<span class="smcap">Peking</span>, <i>23rd May 1865</i>.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> left Tientsing early on Friday morning
the 19th, by which means we had the tide in
our favour, and were able to get quicker clear
of the hideous sights and smells of the river as
it runs through the town. We each had a
boat; Saurin’s was the drawing-room, mine the
dining-room, and his servant occupied the third
as kitchen. They were capital roomy boats,
covered in with hoods of bamboo and rattan
matting, and with a sort of dresser in each
upon which we spread our beds. Each had a
crew of three men, and in Saurin’s, which was
the biggest, there was a boy besides. They
were very cheery, hard-working fellows, and
indeed they had no sinecure, for although
the wind was ostensibly in our favour, still the
river winds round such sharp twists and elbows
that in every other reach it was dead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span> against
us, and we had to proceed laboriously by dint
of towing and punting. But the harder they
worked the better humoured the crew seemed
to be, and the boy especially distinguished
himself by zeal equalling that of an unpaid
attaché. The shoals are innumerable, and we
were constantly crossing the river backwards
and forwards, along a course marked out by
twigs stuck in the mud. There is no scenery
to enjoy, nothing but interminable fields of
millet, and here and there a little wood. There
is not a hillock to be seen, and we were lucky
in being as short a time as possible over what
must be a very dull journey. We reached
Tungchou at three o’clock on Sunday afternoon.
Here we found our horses, with an
escort which had been sent down with them to
meet us.</p>

<p>Tungchou was very busy. A fleet of junks
had come in with grain, and the quay was alive
with crowds of coolies, many of them as naked
as they were born, discharging cargo, sifting
corn, and carrying it into granaries. Our
appearance produced some astonishment, for
“foreign devils” are hardly yet quite familiar
objects so far north. Tungchou was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span> place
where the unfortunate English prisoners were
taken in 1860, and where Wade and Crealock,
carrying a flag of truce and demanding to
parley with the commander, were fired upon
and narrowly escaped with their lives. It is
fortified, as all the northern cities are, but its
walls would only be a security against native
warriors. The roads in this part of the world
are miracles of badness, and it is not difficult to
conceive the tortures that the English prisoners
must have suffered when they were conveyed
along them in native carts without springs, and
having their hands and heels tied together
behind them with cords tightened by water.
Every inch of the road to Peking is famous
from the events of that time. Some way outside
Tungchou we rode over the bridge of
Palikao,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> where the Chinese crossed their spears
with the French bayonets, and held their own
for half an hour. From this bridge the Général
de Montauban takes his title. Its kylins and
stone flags still bear traces of shot and shell.
Riding through dust over one’s pony’s hocks,
and raising a cloud at every step, is <span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>very dry
work, and I was glad when we struck off the
main road, and, coming upon a tea-house in a
shady nook, stopped to rest and refresh. The
people received us with the utmost <i lang="fr">bonhomie</i>
and civility, and brought us delicious tea, without
milk or sugar, in bowls, hard-boiled eggs,
and a sort of roll-twist fried instead of baked.
We soon had ten or twelve yellow gentlemen
round us, eagerly asking all sorts of questions
about ourselves, our ages, and belongings.
Murray talks Chinese fluently, and Saurin
has also some knowledge of it, so we
got on capitally. Our ages always puzzle
Chinamen. They neither wear beard nor
moustache until they have reached the age of
forty, so they think that all Europeans who
wear such appendages must have passed that
age. A single eye-glass is, however, the possession
which commands the most astonishment.
They are familiar with spectacles and
double eye-glasses, for they themselves wear
them of portentous size, and mounted in thick
brass or tortoise-shell rims. But a single glass
is indeed a marvel, and provokes much laughter.
Though the peculiarities of foreigners amuse
the Chinese as much as theirs do <span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>us, it is
singular how their natural courtesy prevents
their showing it in the offensive manner that
every Englishman has experienced in some
foreign countries. I had expected to find the
country on this side of Peking flat, ugly, and
barren. Flat it certainly is, but there are plenty
of trees and rich fields, and it cannot be called
ugly. The villages and graves argue an immense
population. It is not till one is under
the very walls of the town that one sees Peking.
The walls are high, ruinous, battlemented, and
picturesque, of a fine deep gray colour. They
are capped at intervals by towers of fantastic
Chinese architecture, and, with their lofty gates,
make a strange and striking picture. As a
means of defence against modern artillery the
walls of Peking are probably absurd. However,
before I tell you anything about Peking
I had better know something myself. At
present I only know that I was very hot, very
tired, and as dusty as the oldest press in the
Record office, when I rode into the court of
Her Majesty’s Legation, where I received
the warmest welcome from Wade, the <i lang="fr">chargé
d’affaires</i>.</p>

<p>We have received bad Chinese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span> news.
Sangkolinsin, the Mongol chief who commanded at
the Peiho in 1859, and was temporarily disgraced
for not being able to beat off the allies
in 1860, has been killed by the rebels in the
province of Shantung, some 400 miles hence.
He was reputed a brave soldier and an honest
man. Although the Chinese affect to disregard
the importance of the intelligence, there is no
doubt that it is very serious. The fire is burning
everywhere, and they cannot or will not take
the proper means to put it out.</p>

<p class="small"><i>Note.</i>—I should wish to add here one word of admiration and respect
for the memory of Sir Thomas Wade, my first chief in China. He had
been Lord Clyde’s adjutant, but gave up the army for diplomacy. A
great student and master of many languages, his Chinese scholarship
won the admiration even of the learned mandarins with whom he had
to deal. During the two Chinese Wars he distinguished himself, not
only by his great abilities as a negotiator, but also by the most dauntless
courage. Generous and self-sacrificing to a fault, he was one of
the greatest gentlemen I ever met.—1900.</p>

</div>

<p class="right-indent">
<span class="smcap">Peking</span>, <i>1st June 1865</i>.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Wade was in England last year Lord
Stanley said to him: “Peking’s a gigantic
failure, isn’t it? not a two-storied house in the
whole place, eh?” To Lord Stanley’s practical
eye, no doubt, it might be a failure, but an
artist would find much to admire and put on
paper.</p>

<p>Pe-king, which means the northern capital,
as Nan-king means the southern, consists of
two cities, the Chinese and the Tartar, and
within this latter, again, is the Imperial city,
which contains the palace and precincts of the
court. Both cities are surrounded by walls of
dark-gray brick; those of the Tartar city are
fifty feet high, forty feet wide at the top, and
about sixty feet below; the walls of the Chinese
city are less important, being only thirty feet
high. These walls have battlements and loop-holes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
for guns. That of the Chinese city has
fallen into decay, but that of the Tartar is
more carefully repaired. At intervals are lofty
watch-towers standing out against the sky.
High towers stand also above the gates, which
are closed at sunset, after which time ingress
and egress are forbidden.</p>

<p>The streets are broad roads, in most cases
unpaved, and in all uncared for. They are
flanked on each side by shops and low houses,
but their breadth is lessened by the countless
stalls and stands of hucksters of all sorts that
take them up often in quadruple rows. In this
region of dust and dirt the streets are equally
filthy summer and winter. Both in the Chinese
and Tartar cities there are large open spaces
and buildings standing in their own grounds,
covering areas of many acres. In the former
city these are the temples of the Buddhist
and Taoist religions, in the latter they are the
palaces of the Emperor and persons of distinction.
These grounds, planted as they are
with lofty trees, give a great beauty to the
town, and often in the heart of either city there
are spots which are pictures of village life.
Standing among these groves of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>trees the
brilliant colours and fantastic designs of the
Chinese architecture have a wonderfully pleasing
effect. The wall of the imperial palace,
covered with highly glazed yellow tiles, with
towers at the corners shining like gold in
the sun, is especially striking. Whichever way
one turns there is something grotesque and
barbarous to be seen, and the signs of decay
and rot do not detract from the picture. In
fact Peking is like a vast curiosity shop, with
all the dust and dirt which are among the conditions
of bric-à-brac. It would be pleasant-looking
and admiring were it not for the difficulties
of riding through the city owing to the
enormous crowds which block the way—carts,
porters, camels, chairs, pedlars, beggars, lamas,
muleteers, horse-copers from Mongolia, archers
on horseback, mandarins with their suites,
small-footed women, great ladies in carts, closely
veiled to keep off the gaze of the profane
vulgar. In short, every variety of yellow and
brown humanity, not to speak of dogs and pigs,
get into one’s path at every moment, and raise
clouds of dust, which fill eyes, ears, hair, mouth,
and nose, and temporarily destroy every sense
save that of touch. It is as if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span> dust of
all the Derby days since the institution of that
race (by the bye I wonder what horse has won
it this year) had been borne by the winds to
find a permanent home here. A dust-storm in
the north of China is a natural phenomenon.
Clouds draw over the sky as if a thunderstorm
was going to burst. In my inexperience the
first time I saw this I expected rain to fall, but
instead of rain there came a fine dust penetrating
everything and not to be shut out by
door or window. This nuisance, which comes
to us from the great Mongolian deserts, besides
hurting the eyes as common dust by filling them
with extraneous matter, has chemical properties
which produce a smarting and burning pain.
Dust-storms are sometimes so thick that men
lose their way as in a London fog. It is indeed
“a darkness that may be felt.”</p>

<p>The distance round the walls of Peking is
something like twenty-three miles, of which
fifteen must be given to the Tartar city, which
is square in shape and lies to the north of the
oblong Chinese city. Tradition, and the mystery
which for so many years hung over the capital,
have assigned to it an exaggerated population.
The Chinese affected to believe it <span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>contained
two million souls, and that no capital in the
world could compete with it. This may have
been the case in the time of the Emperor
Chien-Lung, who reigned from 1736 to 1795
a.d. But nowadays, judging from the enormous
empty spaces, and from the gardens and courtyards,
which no gentleman’s residence is without,
and even allowing for the dense crowding of
some quarters, it probably does not reach a
million. It is impossible to form any precise estimate
of the numbers of the “Doors and Mouths.”
Doctors disagree, and I have heard the people
of Peking reckoned at various figures, from
six hundred thousand to a million and a half.
Until Peking was opened to Europeans the
southern Chinese used to stick at no lie about
it. For instance, if they were told of some
great scientific invention such as railways, the
electric telegraph, or the like, they would say
at once with the utmost coolness, “Have seen!
Have seen! Have got plenty Peking side!”
And in like manner they lied about its size
and population. The country round about
Peking seems to be very thickly peopled. I
was prepared to find it so, but nevertheless I
had hardly expected to see so <span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>many human
beings and their traces, which are often very
unpleasant, especially in China.</p>

<p>Our Legation is situated in the southern
part of the Tartar city. We occupy a most
picturesque palace called the Liang Kung Fu,
or Palace of the Duke of Liang, which, like all
Chinese buildings of importance, covers an immense
space of ground. There are courtyards
upon courtyards, huge empty buildings with red
pillars, used as covered courts, state approaches
guarded by two great marble lions, and a number
of houses with only a ground floor, each of us
inhabiting one to himself. When the Legation
first came to live here the whole place was
put into repair, and redecorated in the Chinese
fashion with fluted roofs of many colours, carved
woodwork, kylins of stone and pottery, and
all the thousand and one fancies with which
the Chinese cover their buildings. Unfortunately
the repairs were badly executed,
and nothing further has been done to keep
matters straight, so the Legation, which ought
to be as pretty as possible, is really a disgrace
to us. The gardens are a wilderness,
the paving of the courts is broken, the
walls are tumbling down, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span> beautiful
place is going to rack and ruin. In this
climate of extreme heat and cold a stitch in
time saves ninety-nine.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Fancy a residence in
the heart of a great and populous city where
foxes, scorpions, polecats, weasels, magpies,
and other creatures that one expects to find
in the wild country, abound. That will give
you an idea of how space is wasted in Peking.
The great drawback to our palace is its situation.
We have more than an hour’s ride before
we can escape from the city and its stinks, to
breathe a breath of fresh air. It requires an
immense exercise of energy to face an hour’s
ride through the streets of Peking in order to
get a canter in the open; and I am often half
tempted to sell my pony and dismiss my
groom, but this would be tantamount to shutting
myself up for good in the Legation, for walking
at Peking is even more disagreeable than riding.</p>

<p>His Imperial Highness the Prince of Kung,
President of the Council, Chief of the Board
of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister, and what
not besides, sent his card yesterday to announce
to Wade that he would pay him an official visit.
I enclose you his visiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span> card.</p>

<p>The Prince of Kung is the brother of the
late Emperor, and in 1860 was entrusted by
him with the negotiations with Lord Elgin
and Baron Gros. During the minority of the
present Emperor, who is about twelve years
old, the two Empresses-dowager<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> are nominally
regents; but the Prince has the care of the
Emperor’s education, and is virtually the regent
of the empire. He was very nearly meeting
with the fate of Humpty-Dumpty a little while
back, for he was accused of selling places, abuse
of patronage, and insolence in the Presence.
His accuser was supposed to have been instigated
by one of the Empresses who is hostile
to him, and to have been made cat’s-paw of by
a court intrigue. However that may be, the
Empresses issued an edict in the style of the
chorus in the <i>Agamemnon</i> which shows how
prosperity leads to insolence, and insolence to
retribution, and the Prince was deprived of all
his offices and glories. For a few days he remained
in disgrace, but his brothers came to
the rescue, a Grand Council was held, and the
Prince was reinstated in the office of Foreign
Affairs in consideration of his great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span> services.
This, however, did not look well for the Prince,
as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs carries with
it such unpopularity that its possession alone
might be esteemed a doubtful pleasure; and it
was not until his former honours were one by
one restored to him that he could be said to
be reinstated in court favour. The charges
against him were declared unfounded, and
it was agreed that the question of insolence
was a family matter, and should not interfere
with public affairs. Meanwhile his accuser
goes about at large, but about as free as a
mouse that a cat lets slip out of her claws for
a second or two. I would not be in his skin
for something.</p>

<p>A little before the hour fixed for the Prince’s
visit, Hêng-Chi and Tung, two of the Board
of Foreign Affairs, arrived to meet him. Hêng-Chi
is the man whose name became known in
Europe during the war in 1860, and during
Parke’s and Loch’s captivity. He is a little
thin old man very like Mr. Meadows, the
actor at the Princesses’ Theatre, and a great
dandy. He wore a pearl gray silk dress turned
up with blue. His fan-case, chopstick-case,
and other knick-knacks which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span> wears at
his girdle, are richly embroidered, and mounted
with seed pearls and a peculiar clouded pink
coral which the Chinese call baby-face coral.
His snuff-bottle is of the finest Fei Tsui, or
emerald green jade, which is worth its weight
in diamonds here, but of all his possessions
none is in his eyes more charming than a
large silver Geneva turnip watch which he
displays with much pride. In his boot, which is
of black satin, he carries his pipe with its tiny
silver bowl, and a gorgeous Fei Tsui mouthpiece,
together with sweetmeats, pills, and other
trifles. His white cap with the red tassel of
office hanging all round it, has a pink coral
button (Hêng-Chi is a mandarin of the first
button), and the peacock’s feather which falls
from it is mounted in more Fei Tsui. To
crown all, he wears a pair of spectacles as big
as saucers, with broad silver rims. Never
was a little old man so pleased with himself;
his little airs and graces and <i lang="fr">petit-maître</i> ways
are very funny. Tung is a jolly, fat, old
mandarin and a great contrast to Hêng-Chi.
He is a great man of letters, and has translated
Longfellow’s “Psalm of Life” into Chinese
verse. That is, Wade gave him a literal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span> version
of the English, and he made a poem of it,
which is said to have great merit.</p>

<p>In due course of time the Prince arrived
in his chair attended by a number of running
footmen, and an escort mounted on ponies.
Wade and I received him, and I was presented
to him as Mi-ta-jên, the official name
by which my arrival was announced to the
Chinese Foreign Office—we are all obliged to
have monosyllabic names for our intercourse
with the Chinese. Sir F. Bruce was Pu-ta-jên
(the Chinese cannot pronounce an R, so they
rendered his name as Pu-lu-su), Wade is
Wei-ta-jên. Ta-jên, literally “great man,” is
a title denoting official rank, and is that which
is borne by the mandarins.</p>

<p>The Prince is a young man about 28 years
of age, judging by appearances. He is pockmarked,
as indeed is almost every Chinaman
I have seen. He is very shortsighted, and
has the same trick of screwing up his eyes that
I have, and I could not help thinking what a
caricature we should have made as we sat
opposite each other making faces. As soon as
the Prince had taken his seat he drew his pipe
out of his boot, and one of his own <span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>attendants
brought him fire, serving him kneeling on one
knee. Tea was brought as a matter of course,
and then the conversation began. The great
man had a short, flippant manner, and this it
was that so nearly brought him to grief. He
was immensely amused by an English bell-pull,
and a mother-of-pearl paper-knife which lay on
the table. My single eyeglass was a real boon
to the Prince. Whenever he was getting the
worst of an argument, and was at a loss for an
answer, he would stop short, throw up his
hands in amazement, and pointing at me cry
out, “A single eyeglass! marvellous!” By
thus creating a diversion at my expense he gave
himself time to consider his reply. He seemed
very friendly with Wade, and full of jokes and
fun—of course I could not understand a word
of what was said, but I took refuge behind a
big cigar, and looked on vastly amused by our
guest’s ways. I thought I detected a cruel,
cunning look behind all his affectation of good-humour.</p>

<p>When the Prince had gone, Hêng-Chi, who,
besides being part-Minister for Foreign Affairs,
is also a general officer, and many other things,
for pluralism is the order of the day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span> invited
us to a review and breakfast afterwards on the
3rd of June, at six in the morning.</p>

<p>It may be a calumny, but I strongly suspect
Hêng-Chi of dyeing his tail.</p>

<p class="small" id="Note_Page73"><i>Note.</i>—The senior Empress-dowager, who had been the first wife of
the Emperor Hsien Fêng, appears to have been more or less a cypher.
The real power was wielded by the Empress-mother Tsu Hsi. This remarkable
lady was according to some accounts a slave girl, according
to others the daughter of a member of the imperial family. Nor are
the two statements incompatible in a country where adoption of
children holds good. The Emperor wishing to raise a girl in his
harem to the highest position would only need to command one of his
relations to adopt her, and she would at once be an imperial princess
as much as if she had been born in the purple, or rather in the yellow.</p>

<p class="small">The senior Empress-dowager, or Eastern Empress as she was
called, died on 18th April 1881, and the power was then absolutely
and solely in the hands of the Empress-mother. The latter’s son, the
Emperor Tung Chi, had died without issue in 1875, and his cousin, a
child of four, was raised to the Lung Wei or Dragon’s throne in
his stead. The regency remained as before with the two Dowager-empresses.</p>

<p class="small">Dr. Wells Williams, in his <i>Middle Kingdom</i>, a perfect encyclopædia
on all Chinese matters, says, “The Empress-dowager is the most
important subject within the palace, and His Majesty does homage
at frequent intervals, by making the highest ceremony of nine prostrations
before her. When the widow of Kia King reached the age
of sixty in 1836 many honours were conferred by the Emperor. An
extract from the ordinance issued on this festival will exhibit the
regard paid her by the Sovereign:—</p>

<p class="small">“Our extensive dominions have enjoyed the utmost prosperity
under the shelter of a glorious and enduring state of felicity—our
exalted race has become most illustrious under the protection of that
honoured relative to whom the whole court looks up. To her happiness,
already unalloyed, the highest degree of felicity has been super-added,
causing joy and gladness to every inmate of the Six Palaces.
The grand ceremonies of the occasion shall exceed in splendour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span> the
utmost requirements of the ancients in regard to the human relations,
calling forth the gratulation of the whole Empire. It is indispensable
that the observances of the occasion should be of an exceedingly
unusual nature, in order that our reverence for our august parent and
care of her may both be equally and gloriously displayed.... In
the first month of the present winter occurs the sixtieth anniversary of
Her Majesty’s sacred natal day. At the opening of the happy period
the sun and the moon shed their united genial influences on it.
When commencing anew the revolution of the sexagenary cycle the
honour thereof adds increase to her felicity. Looking upward and
beholding her glory, we repeat our gratulations, and announce the
event to heaven, to earth, to our ancestors, and to the patron-gods of
the empire. On the nineteenth day of the tenth moon, in the
fifteenth year of Tao Kwang, we will conduct the princes, the nobles,
and all the high officers, both civil and military, into the presence of
the great Empress, benign and dignified, universally placid, thoroughly
virtuous, tranquil, and self-collected, in favours unbounded; and we
will then present our congratulations on the glad occasion, the
anniversary of her natal day. The occasion yields a happiness equal
to what is enjoyed by goddesses in heaven, and while announcing it
to the gods and to our people, we will tender to her blessings unbounded.”—<i>Middle
Kingdom</i>, vol. i. p. 410.</p>

<p class="small">Rations to soldiers, honours, promotions, pardons, etc., were
ordered in honour of the day—“Every perfectly filial son or obedient
grandson, every upright husband or chaste wife, upon proofs being
brought forward, shall have a monument erected with an inscription
in his or her honour.” Soldiers who had reached the age of ninety
or one hundred received money to erect an honorary portal, and
tombs, temples, and bridges were ordered to be repaired; but, as
Dr. Williams slily remarks, “how many of these exceedingly great
and special favours were actually carried into effect cannot be stated.”</p>

<p class="small">This edict of the Emperor Tao Kwang is of high interest at this
moment (1900), as illustrating the position of the present Dowager-empress
Tsu Hsi, which has seemed so incomprehensible to us
Westerns. An ambitious woman, with the master mind of an
Elizabeth or a Catherine, would, it is easy to perceive, find opportunities
which she has certainly turned to the best, or worst, advantage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span></p>

<p class="right-indent p2">
<i>4th June.</i>
</p>

<p>I wished my friend General Hêng-Chi with
all his soldiers a long way off when my boy came
to pull me out of bed at daybreak yesterday
morning. We had had a great storm the night
before, so the dust was laid, but <i lang="fr">en revanche</i> the
streets were a sea of mud, and many of them
regular rivers, and we had to flounder on, our
horses putting their feet in holes at every step.
It took us nearly an hour and a half of this
work to get to the parade ground on the Anting
plain. The ground was kept by means of sticks
and red string, with a soldier at each stick. We
were shown straight to a small blue tent, where
the general received us with much ceremony.
When we had drunk tea the three generals,
the Russian Embassy, and ourselves left the
tent and took up our place on a small mound.
Our appearance was the signal for the military
music to strike up. The band was composed
of about twelve Chinamen, and their instruments
were large sea shells or conches, out of
which they produced the most dismal and distressing
and continuous howl that it ever was
my bad luck to listen to. I hardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span> know what
to compare it to. You have heard the noise in
a shell—it was like that, but magnified a
million times. As soon as we had taken our
position, a soldier in front of us waved a huge
flag, and the business of the day began. There
were about two thousand soldiers, and they
were to exercise, not with the swords, and bows,
and shields of “the Braves,” but according to
our drill book, which Wade has translated for
them, and with rifles and guns given them by
the Russians. They went through their evolutions
respectably, so said Wade, who is an old
soldier and a first-rate drill; but I own that
when they advanced close up to us and delivered
a volley bang in our faces, I felt that it
was not unlikely that, as at our Volunteer
reviews, a stray ramrod might have been left
in a rifle. However, no accident occurred,
barring the bursting of the powder box of one of
the big guns, by which four men were severely
scorched and five put <i lang="fr">hors de combat</i>, for the
lieutenant in charge of the gun was then and
there collared and summarily bambooed, <i lang="la">coram
populo</i>, for carelessness in giving the word to
fire before the powder box was closed. Such
is <span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>discipline!</p>

<p>The sun was beginning to be very powerful,
so it was a great relief when the review was
declared to be over, and it was announced that
each of the men was to receive three halfpence
for his good conduct that day in the field.
Upon the hearing of this joyful intelligence,
the army to a man went down on one knee, in
token of gratitude, though they knew perfectly
well that they never would see the money.
Poor devils!</p>

<p>Breakfast was served in a temple hard by.
When we sat down Hêng-Chi was not to be
found. It turned out that, with a thoughtfulness
which would have done credit to many a more
civilised host, he had gone to see that the men
of our and the Russian escorts were well cared
for.</p>

<p>A Chinese meal exactly reverses the order
of the things which is practised in Europe.
First came cups of tea, and when these were
all cleared away two tiny saucers were placed
before each person. Then the dessert and
sweets were put upon the table; oranges, apples,
candied walnuts, sweets of all kinds, hemp seed
done up with flour and sugar, apricot kernels
preserved in oil and dried, and other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span> delicacies.
Next came the savoury meats—of these the
most remarkable were sea-slugs, like turtle-soup
in taste, bamboo sprouts, sharks’ fins, and deers’
sinews—all gelatinous dishes are the most highly
prized; the famous bird’s-nest soup is just like
isinglass not quite boiled down. Finally came
a sort of soup of rice. I found it very difficult
at first to eat with chopsticks. The manner
of eating is to dip your chopsticks into any one
of the bowls, and transfer a morsel to your own
saucers, which are not changed, neither are the
chopsticks wiped, during the whole proceeding.
If you wish to pay a person a compliment, you
select a tit-bit with your own chopsticks and
put it on your neighbour’s plate, and he does
the same in return. This gives the entertainment
the appearance of an indecorous scramble,
for one is continually leaning across two or
three people to repay some civility. The dishes
are very rich, and I should think unwholesome
in the extreme. There were upwards of sixty
different eatables put upon the table, and I
must own that although my chopsticks went
into nearly every little bowl, there was not one
which did not please my taste. Native wine
was served to us in little cups of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span> size of our
liqueur glasses; it had rather a pleasant taste,
and was very dry. As soon as breakfast was
over the Chinese gentlemen produced out of
their boots—which seem an inexhaustible receptacle
for everything, from tobacco to state
papers—small pieces of paper, with which they
wiped their mouths and ivory chopsticks, and
then came a piece of Chinese politeness which
is very offensive to Europeans; for it is good
manners here, out of compliment to the host,
and in token of having eaten well and been
satisfied, to produce the longest and loudest
eructations, and Hêng-Chi and the two generals
left nothing to be desired in that respect, making
a great display of good breeding. Tea and
conversation in the court of the temple brought
my first Chinese entertainment to a close. I
can’t tell you how strange it seemed to me to
begin with dessert and end with soup!</p>

<span class="smcap">Peking</span>, <i>23rd June 1865</i>.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> I wrote to you last I have neither
seen nor done anything worth recording. The
thermometer has been standing at from 95° to
107° in our courtyard, so there is not much
temptation to go sight-seeing, or even to move
outside the Legation; inside, the days are
as like as twins. However, there is a bag
going to-day, so I must try and patch up a
letter.</p>

<p>We are thinking of making a move to the
hills next Monday; we have almost decided on
a temple called Pi Yün Ssŭ, about 12½ miles
from this. I shall be very glad to go, for the
town is becoming abominably stuffy and hot, and
the dust is something beyond belief. We shall
probably stay six weeks or two months, coming
into Peking on mail days. We are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span> forced to
take our whole establishment with us, so it is
not worth while going for a shorter time.</p>

<p>By the bye my establishment has been
increased by a teacher; not as in Europe, a
master who is paid so much to come for an
hour a day, but a man who regularly enters my
service, and is at my beck and call whenever I
want him. I have taken a header into Chinese,
and am floundering about in a sea of difficulties.
One great disadvantage that one labours under
is that the native teachers, and there are no
others, of course don’t speak a word of any
language but their own. At first, therefore,
Ku, that’s my man’s name, and I used to sit
and look at one another in a hopeless state of
unintelligibility, until either he got bored, made
signs of having a stomach-ache, and took his
leave, or I could stand him no longer and
dismissed him. However, it is surprising how
quick a man may pick up, not the language
of a strange country, but a jargon that will pass
current, if he is dependent upon it for the
everyday necessaries of life. Teachers, servants,
cooks, and grooms, all must receive their
orders in Chinese; shopping and bargain-driving
increase one’s stock of words;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span> so one
way or another Ku and I get on pretty tolerably.
He will accompany me to the hills, and
as I mean to get through much work there, I
hope that by the time you get this letter I shall
be well started up the stream.</p>

<p>A pleasanter addition to my personnel, and a
sweeter, for he does not eat garlic nor smoke
opium, is a small Manilla poodle, Nou-nou by
name, whom I have inherited. He has consoled
the exile of a succession of diplomatists at
Peking, and has finally fallen into my hands.
He is the jolliest little dog, and has the most
companionable ways. Although only a shade
bigger than your Tiny, he is as plucky as Tom
Sayers, and is the terror of strange dogs and
Chinamen; indeed his valour being much too
great for his body often brings him to trouble.
For many years he would fly at any dog that he
saw in any part of the Legation, and bid him
get out of his majesty’s way; but now he is no
longer in his <i lang="fr">première jeunesse</i>, having received
much hard usage from dogs over whom as
puppies he had been used to exercise a terror,
especially from one big black retriever, who
won’t stand any nonsense. Nou-nou has taken
possession of our courtyard, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span> by tacit
consent the other dogs seem to respect his
authority. If one of them so much as shows
his nose there, Nou-nou pricks his ears, his tail
curls as crisply as of old, and he flies at the
intruder, who quickly disappears. Here Nou-nou
leads a happy life; every one has a kind
word for him, and his only grievance is, that on
Mondays and Thursdays he is carried off by a
big Chinaman, from his holy looks like a pre-Raphaelite
picture, known as “the apostle,”
and summarily washed.</p>

<p>We have better news from Shantung. The
Imperialist troops have driven back the rebels.
There is now no danger of this province being
invaded, which might have been a serious thing
for us, and certainly would have resulted in the
sacking of Tientsing. It is really provoking,
after all the pains that have been taken to
induce this wretched Government to save itself,
which it could easily do by the most ordinary
exertion, to see half a dozen archers outside the
gates making such practice at a target twenty
yards off as any girl of eighteen, member of a
toxophilite club at home, would be ashamed of.
Yet this is the stuff which the Chinese Government
are content to accept as the means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span> of putting
down the insurrection. The troops that they
are drilling in the European fashion are merely
a sop to foreign representatives, and not the
evidence of earnest wishes to improve. Self-help
and self-improvement seem repugnant to
the nature of this belly-patting Buddhist nation.
They are willing enough to get foreign officers,
especially Englishmen, in whom the example of
Colonel Gordon has given them unbounded
confidence, to drill and lead their troops; but
they will do nothing for themselves; and there
is a class of superior officers (such as Li, the
governor of the province in which Shanghai is
situated) who, having acquired a certain reputation
for valour and military ability among their
own people, consider it beneath their dignity to
serve under foreign officers. The obstacles
which such men throw in the way of the latter,
together with the uncertainty of being able to
obtain supplies and pay for the troops under
their command, render their position intolerable,
as Colonel Gordon found on more than
one occasion. The English officers who have
been lent to instruct the Imperialists have found
their way in many instances anything but
smooth, and have had great difficulty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span> in carrying
out the measures which they deemed necessary.
Under these circumstances, it is not to be
wondered at that the rebels, whose ranks are
swelled by the local banditti, secret societies,
and Imperialist soldiers mutinous for want of
pay, should still show a head.</p>

<p>With this internal difficulty pressing them
sorely, the Chinese continue persistently to
break their treaty engagements with the Great
Powers, any of which, if it were so minded, has
a handle for blowing up the whole concern.
Wên-Hsiang, who is the chief of the Board of
Foreign Affairs [which he virtually directs,
although the Prince of Kung is nominally
at its head], and who is the most advanced
and patriotic man in the Government, is
fully conscious of the danger of the situation;
but unfortunately he is a timid man, and it is
one thing to convince a Chinaman, and another
to induce him to act upon his conviction. So
the treaties continue to be broken, and the existence
of the present dynasty in China hangs
upon the patience of foreign governments, who
have too great a stake in the country to sink
the ship so long as there is a hope of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
floating.</p>

<p>It is only fair to say, on the other hand, that
the residence of foreign representatives at
Peking during the last four years has certainly
been productive of some good. As an evidence
of this, Dr. Martin, an American missionary,
has produced, at the expense of the Board of
Foreign Affairs and with the co-operation of a
commission specially appointed by the Prince
of Kung, a translation into the Chinese language
of Wheaton’s <i>International Law</i>. To
this Tung-ta-jên, whom I mentioned in my last
letter to you as the translator of Longfellow’s
“Psalm of Life,” has added a preface. This
preface, coming as it does from the vice-president
of the College of Historians, one of the
chiefs of the lettered class in China, adds great
authority to the work, the publication of which
is certainly an event of importance in the history
of the country.</p>

<span class="smcap">Pi Yün Ssŭ</span>, <i>7th July 1865</i>.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> will see by the date of this that we
have beaten a retreat from the dust, heat, and
filth of the city, and that our “villegiatura”
has begun. Indeed, Peking was becoming insupportable.
The thermometer when we left
was standing at 108° in the shade, the highest
degree which it has reached for these three
years, and I was heartily glad to turn my back
upon the Legation gates.</p>

<p>The plain between these hills and the town
is very beautiful. It is thickly studded with
farmsteads, knolls of trees, and tombs, which
are always the prettiest spots in China, for as a
balance against the dirt and squalor in which
they pass their lives, the Chinese choose the
most romantic and delightful places for their
final habitations. The soil is wonderfully fertile,
and yields two crops in the year, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span> usually
the plain bears every appearance of prosperity;
but this year, owing to the excessive heat and
drought, the first crop has failed, and the fields
are parched and burnt up. In vain the Emperor
prays for rain; it only comes in rare and
scanty showers, and the fierce sun bakes the
ground harder than ever. The country folk
are in great distress, and food is at famine
prices. Yet they seem happy and contented,
and when we asked one of the priests here
whether there was no danger of a famine riot,
he answered, “Oh, no! the people about here
are too great fools to get up a disturbance.”
Those that are hardest up will sell their daughters
into bondage, and there will be an end of the
matter.</p>

<p>The hills west of Peking are the Switzerland
of Northern China. They are not very
high nor extraordinarily beautiful, but there are
some very pretty gorges and valleys, richly
wooded, and at any rate the air is fresh and
pure. Every gorge has a perfect nest of
temples, built by the pious emperors of the
Ming dynasty and the earlier Tartars, for which
good deeds the <i lang="fr">Corps diplomatique</i> at Peking
cannot be too grateful. Properly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span> speaking,
according to the rules of their order, the
Buddhist monks are forbidden to receive any
money for the hospitality which they offer to
strangers, so when the Chinese go to stay at a
temple they restore or beautify some part of it
as a return; but we prefer paying a few dollars,
and in spite of their statutes the arrangement
seems to suit the monks as well as it does us.</p>

<p>Our temple is called “Pi Yün Ssŭ,” “the
temple of the azure clouds,” a romantic name,
and certainly the place is worthy of it. It is
built on terraces ascending the hill to a length
of about half a mile, and on every terrace is a
shrine, each more beautiful (if that is the proper
word to apply to the grotesque buildings of this
country) than the last; black and white marble
statues and vases, bronze dragons, alto-relievos
and basso-relievos representing kings and
warriors, gods and goddesses, and fabulous
monsters, all of rare workmanship,—inscriptions
graven on marble and stone, and bronze
or gilt upon wood, meet one at every step;
and the whole is set in a nest of rock-work,
fountains, woods, and gardens. At the top is
a small temple more in the Indian than the
Chinese style, and here there is a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span> curious
idol with ten heads, three large ones at the
bottom, from which three smaller ones spring,
in their turn carrying three lesser ones surmounted
by a single very small head. The
hands are in proportion. This little place commands
a panoramic view over the plain, with
the walls and towers of Peking in the distance.</p>

<p>Our habitation consists of several little
houses on one side of the temple; we dine in
an open pavilion, surrounded by a pond and
artificial rockery, with ferns and mosses in profusion;
high trees shade it from the sun, and
close by us a cold fountain pours out of the
rock into the pond, in which we can ice our
wine to perfection. The pond was dried up,
and the fountain had been turned from its
channel, when we arrived; but we got together
a few coolies, and soon set that right. Fancy
our feelings on coming here, when we were
told that if there came no rain we could have
no bath! This too in a climate where the hot
nights make a morning wash doubly necessary.
The priest had hardly said the word, when a
tremendous thunderstorm broke over the mountain
and set our minds at rest, and next morning
we discovered that we could have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span> the most
delicious natural bath. Our life here is very
simple and very, very dull. We are only two—Saurin
and myself. We rise at any hour
after daybreak, breakfast at eight, dine at
three; after dinner we go for a ride, or a
scramble over the mountain, and come home
to tea at about eight or nine. We sit smoking
our cheroots for perhaps an hour, talking
always about home and watching the fire-flies,
that, according to Chinese tradition, served as
lamps to Confucius and his disciples. A visit
from or to the Russian Legation, who have got
a temple at about an hour and a half’s ride
from here, is the only break to the monotony
of our daily life. I have my teacher with me
here, and work with him at the language from
breakfast to dinner; that is my serious occupation,
and about as hard a task as one could
wish for. I carry about my lessons for the rest
of the day written on paper fans—a capital
dodge for keeping one’s work before one. We
are rather bothered by mosquitoes, and a most
venomous little insect called the sand-fly, yellow
in colour, and smaller than a midge, which is
lucky, for if he were of the size of a blue-bottle
I should think his bite would be fatal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span> There
are quantities of scorpions too; one of our men
was stung the other day. We heard a great
wailing and crying one night, for all the world
like an Irish wake; next morning our servants
told us that the cook’s assistant had been stung
in the hand, and that he had died in an hour,
but that he had come to rights again, and was
getting well. This sounded something like
being “kilt entirely.” The man’s presence at
the temple illustrates a custom of the country;
of course, as is the way of the East, no one can
move without a large retinue. There must be
a valet for each man, and a groom for each
horse, and a man or two to do nothing, and
two or three more to look on and see them do
it. But besides this, like Thackeray’s description
of Irishmen and their poor relations, no
Chinaman is so poor or mean but what he can
find a poorer and a meaner to do part of his
work. A coolie earning three dollars a month
will pay another one dollar a month to help
him, and he in his turn will give a boy a few
cash, that he may enjoy his ease and his opium.
The man who was stung was the cook’s poor
relation. Although his brother and the other
men supposed him to be dying, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span> finally to
have actually died, they never came and told
us, nor did they get any assistance for him.
We heard the noise, but one of our servants
has a very pretty little talent for tickling a lute,
and there was so little difference between the
sounds of the wake and those of the concerts
he gets up, that we thought the hullabaloo was
only a melancholy variety of the latter, so we
took no notice of it. As far as Chinese remedies
are concerned, better be without them.
It is almost impossible to believe the amount
of ignorance which exists in China about medicine
and surgery. Native doctors, who never
dissect, are utterly ignorant for the most part
of the position of the heart, the lungs, and the
other principal organs. They are ignorant of
the difference between arteries and veins, nor
do they understand the circulation, looking
upon the several pulses of the body as the
effects of separate causes. All diseases are
attributed by them to their favourite doctrine,
“hot and cold influences.” They have a certain
knowledge of the use of drugs, and of mercury
in particular, but their remedy above all others
is acupuncture. Some days ago my groom had
an attack of diarrhœa, and his <span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>medical man
pricked him underneath the tongue for it! Sir
John Davis tells a story of a doctor who wanted
to prick a man for hernia. If in these prickings
they cut into an artery, and the man dies, why,
so much the worse for him! it is fate.
Astrology plays a great part in their medical
art, certain planets being supposed to influence
certain parts of the body. It is one among
many instances in which one sees the analogy
between the present condition of China and
Europe in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p class="right-indent">
<span class="smcap">Peking</span>, <i>8th July 1865</i>.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have ridden in to spend three days,
copying despatches and sighing for our “cool
grot.” The town seemed too beastly as we
came in. Peking, as Southey said of Exeter, “is
ancient and stinks.” The “Beggar’s Bridge,”
which we have to pass every time we go into
the Chinese city, and nearly every time we go
out, is the most loathsome and stinking exhibition
that it ever was my fate to come across.
Here every day a hundred or two of the most
degraded specimens of humanity congregate
and beg. By far the greater majority of them
are clothed only in dirt, and all sorts of repulsive
cutaneous complaints; some have a linen
rag, but it is worn over the shoulders, and in
no way serves as a decent covering. Lice,
mange, scrofula, leprosy, and filth are allowed
to remain undisturbed by water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span> or drugs.
They are a stock-in-trade, and as such rather
encouraged than not. It is a sickening sight
when these creatures come and perform the
ko̔to̔u to us, prostrating themselves in the dust
or mud, which is scarcely as dirty as themselves.
I spare you a description of the food I have
seen them eating. If ever I get back to
Europe, I feel that the Beggar’s Bridge will
be a nightmare to me for the rest of my life.
All this strikes one with double force after
spending a fortnight in the country among the
healthy, sunburnt natives of the hills. I assure
you that they look quite handsome after the
yellow townsfolk. It would amuse our friends
at home, if they could see us the centre of a
group of thirty or forty of these brown villagers,
in some out-of-the-way valley where Englishmen
are about as often seen as Chinamen in
Yorkshire. They ask us all the most absurd
questions about ourselves, our clothes, and our
dogs, who are quite as great objects of wonder
as ourselves. They never will believe that
Nou-nou is not some variety of sheep, and
Saurin’s pointer, a very handsome young dog
of French royal breed, comes in for much
admiration. The women are all frightened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span> at
us, and keep well out of the way; we see them
timidly peering out of their doors at the foreign
barbarians who kill little children, and use their
eyes for photography, but it is seldom that anything
but a stout old matron of great courage
will venture to come near us. The people are
beginning to get rid of their prejudices against
us, and to see that we mean them no injury; at
any rate they are quite friendly, and seem to
look upon us as harmless eccentric creatures, but
very ugly. As for personal safety, no one ever
dreams of carrying arms, either by day or by
night, and nobody is ever insulted or attacked.</p>

<p>We hear bad news of mercantile prospects
in the south. Notwithstanding their having
been hit so hard last season, the merchants
have been speculating again more rashly than
ever, and vying with each other in buying up
tea. The Chinese are quite up to this, and
have leagued together to raise prices. The
nearer our merchants have got to the tea-growing
districts by means of the opening of
new ports, the dearer tea has become. Tea
was never so cheap as when Canton was the
only outlet to the market. This seems a
paradox, but it is easily explained.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span> The
merchants competing to buy on the spot have
caused the Chinese growers to send up their
prices to any height, and the foreigner cannot
transport the tea south so cheaply as the native,
so that both the original price paid to the
farmers, and the cost of transport, have been
raised, and the merchants are paying the penalty
of their own hunger for new markets.</p>

<p>As a set-off against this bad news, we have
good tidings with regard to the rebels, who
were in Shantung; they appear to be dispersed,
some south and some west, and the
capital is safe. For once the Chinese can lay
the praise to themselves, they having acted
without foreign aid.</p>

<p class="right-indent">
<span class="smcap">Pi Yün Ssŭ</span>, <i>21st July 1865</i>.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I daresay</span> you will be curious to hear something
more of our temple life than I have been
able to tell you hitherto. We have been exploring
the neighbourhood in all directions, and
certainly there is plenty to be seen, although
all the points of interest are temples, either
Buddhist or Taoist, and the description of one
might hold good for all. The most curious of
these is at a distance from us of about a mile
and a half; it is called Wo-Fo-Ssŭ, “the temple
of the Sleeping Buddha,” from a huge sleeping
idol which it contains, about 20 feet in
length. At first I thought the figure was meant
for a female, a sort of Sleeping Beauty in the
Wood, but the attendant priest assured me that
it was meant for Buddha himself. The idol
lies sleeping in a huge shrine, surrounded by a
number of lesser saints. His slippers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span> made of
softest velvet and satin, are lying at his feet
ready for him to put on whenever it shall suit
his Holiness to get up; each of his attendants is
likewise provided with slippers. He has been
sleeping now for more than 700 years, so
he brings no great profit to the shoemaking
trade. The shrine is held in great reverence,
and is decorated with an inscription by the
Emperor Chien-Lung himself, who seems never
to have lost an opportunity of writing and
building; of both these favourite pastimes of
his, Wo-Fo-Ssŭ bears examples, for leading out
of one of the courts of the temple is a most
beautiful little Imperial abode, now falling into
decay, like everything else here, but which once
must have been perfectly lovely. Of all the
pavilions, courts, rockeries, and shrines, the
Lotus Pond alone remains in all its glory.
Equally in ruins is an Imperial hunting lodge,
close by our temple, standing in the middle of
a deer-park which reaches up to the top of the
mountain, fenced in by a high wall. This, too,
was a favourite resort of Chien-Lung, and he must
have spent a king’s ransom in decorating it;
a gate or two, here and there a summer-house,
and one pagoda of yellow and green tiles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span> show
what it must once have been. But the whole
place has crumbled to pieces, and the deer and
game stray at pleasure through what were once
the gorgeous apartments of the Emperor. The
yellow tiles here, worked in the highest relief
with dragons, griffins, lions, and other emblems,
are marvellous specimens of potter’s work.
Whole pediments are made in small pieces and
so cunningly joined together that they look like
one block. A very small annual expense would
have kept the place in perfect repair; but to
keep in repair is not an Asiatic attribute.
Alongside one of the paths of the park, which
is full of the most delightful resting-places, I
noticed the remains of what looked like a
number of stalls at a fancy-fair, and on inquiring
I found that they were little shops at which
it was the privilege of the eunuchs of the
palace to sell trinkets and other trifles to the
Emperor as he passed with his wives.</p>

<p>Among other things that Chien-Lung did for
these temples, he imported from the palace of
Jo Hol in Manchuria a quantity of a kind of
tree cigala, by Europeans called wee-wees from
the noise they make, by the Chinese called Tatsŭ-chi-liao.
They are the most curious <span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>insects,
and make a clatter which is as if it were produced
by the metal tongues of an accordion.
They go on all day and drive one nearly distracted.
Sometimes one can hardly hear oneself
speak, but the Chinese delight in them,
and my teacher told me the story of their introduction
as if he had been speaking of an
importation of nightingales. Happily at Peking
they declined to flourish; there we have only a
lesser and more piano sort, which it is an Imperial
amusement at certain times of the year
to catch off the trees with long bamboo rods
tipped with bird-lime. The Chinese certainly
find pleasure in what are to us very disagreeable
noises. Fancy a flight of pigeons with
Eolian harps tied to their tails! The first time
I heard it above my head I thought something
dreadful must be going to happen. However,
that fancy has a practical side to it, for it keeps
off the hawks which abound at Peking.</p>

<p>We have been revelling for two days in the
very rare luxury of wet weather. What a
pleasure a real rainy day is in this burnt-up
climate! a day when the hills look as if they
might be Scotch moors, and the temples and
pavilions as if they ought to melt away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span> and be
replaced by the clubs in Pall Mall. On these
wet days we wander about our own place, of
the size of which you may judge from the fact
that one building alone contains Buddha and
his five hundred Lo-hans, or saints of the
third class, larger than life, just like the temple
of which I told you at Canton, where, however,
they are smaller; then whole courtyards
are surrounded by buildings, in which heaven
and hell are represented by hundreds upon
hundreds of wooden dolls. The Buddhist
heaven is a very queer place according to this
view of it, where the height of happiness seems
to consist in riding a tiger or griffin, or some
equally uncomfortable mount; but hell is really
too grotesque, especially the ladies’ department,
where the unfortunate women who have
sinned in this world are to be seen experiencing
what is, to say the very least of it, very inconsiderate
treatment at the hands of a number
of lavender-kid-glove-coloured fiends. In the
gentlemen’s department a favourite punishment
is for sinners to have their heads cut off, and
be compelled to walk about with them under
their arms like a crush hat at a ball. No
description of mine could give you <span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>any idea
of the absurdity and ugliness of the idols and
dolls. I can’t say that, so far as I can judge,
any real respect is paid to them. The people
seem to make sort of picnic parties here, quite
as a matter of sightseeing, rather than of
religion, just as some tourists visit cathedrals
for their beauty and for the art treasures which
they contain, and not as an act of worship.
However, they call visiting a temple “Kwang
Miao,” which means to do an act of respect
and worship, so perhaps some may attach a
religious importance to it. The priests at our
temple are a lazy, brutish lot, and rather inclined
to be insolent. At Wo-Fo-Ssŭ they are
far more respectable, and a man who was staying
there told me that they had constantly
choral service in the temple, especially at
night; here I very rarely hear the bell and
drum beat for prayers. I must do our priests
the justice to say that one day I offered one of
them a glass of wine, which their laws forbid,
but their stomachs crave for, and he refused,
although there was no one by to have told the
tale, so I suppose they have a conscience somewhere
and that they regard its pricks.</p>

<p>I am sorry to say that by being out <span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>here we
missed seeing the state funeral of the famous
general San-Ko-Lin-Sin. He was carried all
the way to Peking from Shantung, where he
was killed, every mandarin on the road being
bound to furnish men to bear his body. The
Emperor pays the expense of his funeral and of
his lying in state at Peking, and went himself
to pour a libation before the coffin. San-Ko-Lin-Sin
was a feudal Mongol prince, and his
son has now been created a Wang, or prince.
There are many people who say that the
general was not killed by the rebels, but by
his own troops. The account of his death,
however, was given with great details, and he
was probably killed fighting. “A corner of
the Great Wall has gone,” say the Chinese, in
their picturesque way, when a great general is
killed in battle.</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> mail in—we are expecting it any minute,
but have begun to fear that we must send off
our bag before its arrival. I never saw anything
so curious as the change which the last
few wet days have caused in all the face of
the country—its whole appearance is altered.
What were before arid and desert patches of
sand are now turned into green and luxuriant
corn-fields—roads that were like dried water-courses,
with six inches of dust lying on them
and banks of sand on each side, are fresh
English-looking lanes. The crops have sprung
up to be so tall, that we could not see our
usual landmarks, and lost our way; for the
plain between Peking and the hills is so scarred
and intersected by roads and paths, that one
has to make straight for some point in the
distance, or one is thrown out—all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span> houses
and groups of cottages are exactly like one
another and afford no assistance in steering;
it is a regular Chinese puzzle. The thermometer
has fallen from 108° in the shade to
75°. Such a relief!—I hope that we have now
got quit of the very great heat.</p>

<p>By the bye, in my last letter I spoke about
Chinese doctors and prescriptions, and their
doctrine of the hot and cold influences. My
teacher has been telling me about their
principles of diagnosis. It appears that they
attach great importance to examining the
tongue. Now if the tongue is white the
patient is under the cold influence. If it is
yellow, he is under the hot influence. If
the centre of the tongue is white, and the
edges yellow, he is under the cold influence
inside, and his skin is under the hot—and so
<i lang="la">vice versa</i>. Palmistry and the study of the
face and features are also brought to bear
upon medicine—certain conditions of feature
portend certain events in the future. My
teacher told me that he feared he should not
be long-lived, because the lobe of his ear was
small—a large lobe to the ear is much admired
on all accounts, but specially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span> as a
sign of wisdom, and Buddha and the other
idols are represented with huge appendages.
A soft hand is the sign of longevity; the eyes,
nose and nostrils, and chin, all have certain
prophetic meanings to those who are wise to
read them. I told my teacher about phrenology—he
was delighted with the idea, and
stood open-mouthed while his bumps were
being felt. His character, however, did not
interest him much, but he was very anxious to
know how long he would live, and whether he
would hold an office of any kind.</p>

<p>We have no news.</p>

<p class="right-indent">
<span class="smcap">Peking</span>, <i>7th August 1865</i>.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> extreme heat has left us at last, and the
autumn has set in—a most charming season
in this climate. It is a regular second spring—not
such a spring as we are used to in
England, which is a struggle for mastery between
hot sun and chilling east winds, but a
season in which the burnt-up vegetation literally
<i>springs</i> into life again under the influence
of quickening rain and warmth—the trees put
forth shoots and tender green leaves, and the
plain is one rich field of millet twelve feet high,
through which one rides feeling like Gulliver
in the farms of Brobdingnag. The rains have
driven us out of our temple at the hills, which
I much regret, but it had become untenable
lately owing to damp; the scorpions, too, began
to come into the house in too great numbers to
be pleasant; five were killed in my room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span> in two
days, besides other creeping things. There
were quantities of lizards also in my house.
The Chinese have an idea that lizards, which
they call scorpion-tigers, kill the scorpions by
making them commit suicide in this wise: the
lizard touches the scorpion on the back with
his tail, the creature strikes at him, but the
enemy is too quick, and he stings himself
instead; this is repeated until the lizard sees
that the scorpion’s poison is exhausted, when
he goes at him at once and eats him. We
rather exploded this theory, for we caught two
scorpions and two lizards, and put them in a
box with a glass cover, and the only result was
that the large scorpion ate the smaller, continuing
his cannibal feast during ten hours, and
leaving nothing of him but the tip of his tail;
so we let the lizards go and killed the scorpion,
whom Shao-To, our head man, considered to
have become doubly venomous as he must
have the poison of two in him.</p>

<p>Before leaving the hills we took a great
walk over all the summits in order to get a
thorough idea of the country around. It looks
as if the sea, now about 100 miles off, must
once have washed the foot of the mountains,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
forming bays, promontories, and headlands into
the plain, which has the same appearance of
being alluvial as that of Troy. The numberless
watercourses which intersect it show that
formerly there must have been a far greater
flow of water towards the sea than is ever
seen now, even in the rainiest season. From
the highest peak we had a magnificent view
of Peking, Yuen-Ming-Yuen, and the villages
around, and behind us was another range of
mountains, more wild, more rugged and picturesque
than that on which we stood. It
was raining slightly, and as we watched there
came on one of the strangest atmospheric
effects I ever saw. Between us and Peking
there was a faint mist, while over the city itself
a heavy cloud was hanging, partly black and
partly lurid, with a sort of hellish glare about
it that was perfectly indescribable. All around
us there was a deep blue gloom; it was such a
scene as Lot’s wife may have looked upon.</p>

<p>We rode into town the day before yesterday,
and made a circuit so as to take Yuen-Ming-Yuen,
the famous summer palace, on our way.
It was a new road to me, and a very pleasant
one. We passed several Chinese villages,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
principally composed of soldiers’ barracks, like
elongated cow-sheds, and one very pretty
prosperous-looking little city. As we drew
near the Imperial grounds the scenery became
prettier and prettier; above all there were
shady groves, which were doubly delightful
for the scorching morning sun that was blazing
upon us. Quaint stone and marble bridges
were thrown over the dykes and water-channels,
and little gables of pagodas, charged with the
inevitable tile gurgoyles, peeped out of the
woods at intervals.</p>

<p>Yuen-Ming-Yuen (“the round bright garden”)
is one of three parks containing Imperial
palaces, two of which were destroyed in 1860.
Some of the more out-of-the-way buildings
in the third escaped notice and destruction.
The name Yuen-Ming-Yuen has been wrongly
given by Europeans to the whole, and still
more wrongly to the only one of the three
parks (the third park is called Yu-Chuan-Shan,
or the “Hill of the Fountain of Jewels”) that
can be seen, and which we visited. The proper
name of this is Wan-Shao-Shan, the “Hill of
the Ten Thousand Longevities,” which is a
figure of speech for the fête day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span> of the
Emperor or Empress. Of course it is against
the orders of the Chinese authorities that this
is shown, but the guardians of the place make
a good profit out of it, and if they were caught
they would always be ready with the excuse
that “the barbarians forced their way in and
would not be kept out.”</p>

<p>We were ushered through a number of courtyards,
where there was nothing to be seen but
ruined and charred walls, and the ghosts of
departed pine-trees, and along a pretty covered
walk to a pavilion by the lake where we were
to breakfast. It was a lovely spot. The lake
is a mass of lotus plants now in full flower;
there are quantities of little islands covered
with trees and buildings. A number of boats
with naked fishermen in them gave a touch of
wildness and barbarity to the scene, and further
added to our amusement; for one of the men,
in the hopes of finding Heaven knows what
small loot among the masses of rubbish where
there is not so much as a tile left whole, had
come on shore and was lying hidden among the
ruins; whom when the guardians perceived,
they set up such a game of hare and hounds,
and such a throwing of stones and bad language,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
as reminded me of Eton days when a boy from
another house was found in my dame’s without
being able to give a good account of himself.
When the brave men returned all panting and
out of breath, they were very proud of themselves,
and told us the story with much vigour
and dramatic action, for it was a very valiant
deed, as they were only three to one, “with
power to add to their number.”</p>

<p>There is nothing like a Chinese servant for a
picnic or expedition of any kind, under whatever
difficulties he may be placed. Shao-To
never lets us lack for anything. Even Dan,
the pointer puppy, had his usual mess of rice
and broth, as if he had been at home. When
we had breakfasted, with an admiring crowd
around us, we went to explore the ruins. It is
difficult to form any idea of what the palace
must have been like, so complete has the
work of destruction been. We scrambled up
and down steep steps (that must have been
hard work for the poor little cramped feet
that trod them) and along terraces where the
wild vines and creepers, and sweet-scented
weeds, now grow in tangled masses; there
is not a stone that has not been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span> split
by the action of the fire. Two colossal
marble kylins, of rare workmanship, are seared
with cracks, and have almost fallen away in
flakes. Of the great octagonal three-storied
palace, not one stone lies on another, and a
white marble balustrade alone shows where it
stood. Higher up there are still a few remains
untouched by fire. There is a little bronze
temple, a perfect gem, which of course escaped,
and two little revolving wooden pagodas full of
small gods and images standing in a tower were
also preserved; whilst above all a larger temple,
built entirely of the yellow and green tiles I
have so often described to you, shows what a
blaze of glory the place must once have been.
But that glory has passed away now, and so
rapidly does ruin work in this climate, that soon
even the little that remains to-day will perish.
There is one very curious device thoroughly
Chinese that I must mention. At the end of
the terrace by the lake a sort of jetty stands
out, built of huge blocks of stone, in the shape
of a junk being launched into the lake, forty-one
paces long by nine broad. Some of the rockwork
is very quaint. When the Chinese come
upon a quaintly-shaped rock or stone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span> they
mount it on a pedestal and make an ornament
of it. There are many very curious specimens
at Wan-Shao-Shan.</p>

<p>With regard to the destruction of the summer
palace, I believe that, politically speaking, it was
a mistake. It was necessary that some great
reprisal should be made for the outrages committed
by the Chinese; but the destruction
should have taken place inside the city, and not
twelve miles off; for so ignorant are the large
body of the Chinese of what passes outside their
four walls, that there are many here in Peking
who to this day believe that we had to pay an
indemnity for leave to withdraw our troops, and
that we are only here on sufferance. If this is
the case in Peking, in the provinces people
must be still further from the truth, and it is the
policy of the Government to keep up the delusion.
Had the Imperial palace in Peking been
destroyed the matter would have been notorious
to all, and its recollection would not have been
blown away with the last cloud of smoke from
Yuen-Ming-Yuen.</p>

<p>Here is some more Chinese doctoring which
may amuse you. A boy was brought the other
day to the hospital of the London Mission<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span> with
slight feverish symptoms. The doctor not
being at home, the boy was taken by his parents
to a Chinese practitioner, who prescribed a
decoction of three scorpions, to be taken
internally! The boy was well next day in spite
of it.</p>

<p>A recipe for ophthalmia, posted on the walls
of Peking, runs as follows:—Take three bright
brass coins of the reign of Tao Kwang, boil them
in water, and use the lotion. Here is our old
saw, “A hair of the dog that bit you,” worked
in practice: For a dog bite, catch the dog, pull
out a few of his hairs, and work them into a
paste with a little lime and oil—apply the paste
to the wound; of course, the lime acting as a
caustic is the real remedy, but the hair is the
one that is believed in.</p>

<p>The Legation is at present giving hospitality
to a certain gentleman who is accredited
by a small state to make a treaty with the
Chinese, as he pompously announces “dans
l’intérêt de la Chine même”; if he does not
talk less big at the Tsung-Li Yamên, or Foreign
Office, he will find the Chinese far less tractable
than he seems to think it their duty to be; for
they are much too sharp to suppose that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span> anybody
comes out here to negotiate treaties in their
interest without having a still keener eye
upon his own; and as for themselves, of
course the mandarins, at any rate, would
rather return to the old state of things, have
nothing to do with us and our treaties, and
sacrifice the revenue that accrues to them
from their customs. The pressure put upon
them from abroad, and the counsels of Mr.
Hart, the Chinese Inspector-General of
Customs, and a very able man, alone keep
them straight, and compel the central Government
to assume responsibilities which they
would rather leave to the provincial authorities.
Fancy the difficulty of stirring up into action
men whose highest idea of celestial happiness
is an eternity passed in the contemplation of
their own paunches, in the society of Buddha
and his Lo-hans.</p>

<p>It is very hard upon our interpreters that
they should have to do the work of other
missions besides our own. These ministers
of other states come up here without any staff
whatever, and the whole of their business falls
upon the Legation to whose good offices they
may be intrusted.</p>

<p class="right-indent">
<span class="smcap">Peking</span>, <i>22nd August 1865</i>.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> I last wrote to you we have been
leading the most monotonous of lives, and no
news from home has come to cheer us. We
have had staying with us one of the few
stray visitors that chance drives up here—a
Mr. R——, an officer in the commissariat, and
a very pleasant companion he was; he came
fresh from Japan, and full of stories about
Yokohama and Yedo, but out here we should
prefer to hear about London. There really is
little temptation to travellers to come here now,
for, thanks to the misbehaviour of certain of
our countrymen, the Chinese have shut up the
principal lions of the town, and the temples of
Heaven, and of Confucius, are not shown, even
to members of the Legations. I for one have
not been able to visit them. The great Lama
Temple is still to be seen, and to any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span> one who
has not seen a Chinese temple, is a great
show; but they are all very like one another, the
main difference being merely a question of size.
It is very provoking to be kept out of really
interesting sights by the brutality of travelling
bullies who will force their way into places
where they have no right to go.</p>

<p>All we can do now for our visitors is to show
them the panorama of the two cities from the
walls, the top of which forms a ride or walk
right round Peking, and where the wonderful
observatory of the old Jesuit fathers, with its
beautiful bronze instruments, still stands, and to
take them through the streets and over the
curio shops—braving offence given to eyes and
nostrils. The curio shops especially make up
an amusing day, and I am always glad of an
excuse to go there. There is a bazaar, too,
just inside the Chinese city, a sort of Lowther
Arcade on a small scale, where toys, scents,
sham jewellery, cheap embroidery, and other
rubbish are sold, and which is quite worth
seeing. This is greatly patronised by the
Mongols, who never weary of admiring the
showy trash exposed for sale. The Mongols
are to the Pekingese what the Auvergnats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span> are
to the <i lang="fr">gamins de Paris</i>, or a bumpkin come up
to London for the cattle-show to the cabbies
and ’busmen. They are the perpetual butts of
jokes, sells, and cheatery, and are done at every
opportunity. The bazaar leads on to the
Beggar’s Bridge, with its mass of rotting
humanity, a place that it makes one shudder to
think of, and once past that we are well in the
Chinese city. The amount of traffic is always
very great, and it is no easy matter to thread
one’s way through the crowd of mules, carts,
horses, and footpads, and the worst of it is that
one is continually hustled up against some unhappy
leper, whose only clothing is dirt and
sores. The neatness and nicety of the shops
are a great contrast to the filth and squalor
of the streets themselves. Inside everything
is as clean as water can make it; outside is a
dunghill, where the beggars are disputing with
the dogs and pigs the right to water-melon
rinds, rotten vegetables, and dead carrion.
The street hawkers are a great feature; of
course they all have their peculiar cries as in
Europe; but in addition to this each trade has
its own announcement in the shape of some
instrument—one trade carries a thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span> like a
huge Jew’s harp, another has a tiny gong, a
third a drum, a fourth beats two pieces of
bamboo together, and so forth. All these make
a terrible clatter, and the noise is increased by
the beggars, who take up a position opposite
some shop—a cook-house for choice—and there
make themselves odious to eyes, ears, and nostrils
until its owner can stand it no longer and buys
them off with a copper cash or piece of refuse
food. Among Chinese street characters the
<i lang="it">improvisatore</i> is one of the foremost. He is as
loud and fluent as his Italian compeer, and
infinitely more energetic. He generally accompanies
himself on the bones, but often has a
little boy to beat a drum for him. He works
himself into a regular frenzy, and jumps about
like one possessed of a devil; he dances and
gesticulates and raves until the sweat runs down
his face; but nothing tires him, and he never
halts nor pauses in his chant. These men are
too nimble of speech and too slang for most
foreigners to catch a word; but I suppose they
are generally witty and entertaining, for they
command immense audiences of gaping Chinamen,
and their sallies are received with great
delight. Like the Italians, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span> they have
worked up their audience to a proper pitch of
interest they stop, and refuse to go on with the
story without more coppers. At the approach
of the foreign barbarian some little witticism
is launched <i lang="fr">à notre adresse</i>. You may judge
whether it is very complimentary; however, as
“it amuses them and don’t hurt us,” that don’t
much signify. Perhaps the hawkers whose
wares are the most curious to Europeans are the
men who carry about live crickets and cicadas
for sale, either in tiny wooden cages or tied to
bamboo rods. The Chinese buy them to any
amount as pets, and some make the crickets
fight like quails and game-cocks.</p>

<p>We are very often accosted by the more respectable
class. The first salutation is always,
“Have you had your dinner, sir?” which is the
Chinese, “How d’ye do?” and then the conversation
runs as follows:—</p>

<p class="indent2">“Your honourable name?”</p>

<p class="indent2">“My name is Mi. What is your honourable
name?”</p>

<p class="indent2">“My shabby name is Hwang. What are
the years of your age?”</p>

<p class="indent2">“I am twenty-eight” (great astonishment,
for I pass usually for forty-five).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span></p>

<p class="indent2">“How long have you been inside the walls?”
(at Peking).</p>

<p class="indent2">“About four months.”</p>

<p class="indent2">“Do you belong to the great Ying, or the
great Fa?” (English or French).</p>

<p>Then follow a string of the most absurd
questions about England. One man asked one
day whether it was true that in Europe there
were men with holes through their chests and
backs, whom their servants carried about by
passing a bamboo pole through the hole and
so hoisting them on to their shoulders. Such
is the Chinese education, that one of their
scholars, deeply read in ethics and Confucian
books, would be capable of asking questions
to the full as ridiculous as the above, which,
indeed, was put by an educated man.</p>

<p>After the din, bustle, and dirt of the streets,
it is very refreshing to go into one of the shops,
where there is always the civillest welcome, even
though one may buy nothing. In almost all
cases the master of the house gives us delicious
tea, sugarless and milkless of course, but of the
most exquisite flavour. The infusion is made
in a small covered bowl; I have hardly ever
seen a teapot. The outer shop is for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span> the most
part only, as it were, an advertisement, and
contains nothing but trash: one of the finest
shops here exhibits to the street a front such
as a Cheap Jack at a fair might show; but go
inside, and cross a little courtyard into the inner
sanctum, and you will be dazzled by the beauty
of the ornaments and trinkets for sale. There
is a certain black <i lang="fr">étagère</i> made of ebony, carved
to represent very light bamboo stems supporting
irregular niches, filled with carved lapis-lazuli,
jade, cornelians, agates, and other rare
stones, that I should like to carry off bodily.
Every piece in the collection is a <i lang="fr">chef-d’œuvre</i>.
The prices are, of course, outrageous, but they
come down; indeed, it is curious that a people
so proverbially cunning in trade should act as
they do. Supposing that they ask thirty dollars
for a thing, we offer fifteen, which, at first, will
be indignantly rejected; but after perhaps
three months of bargaining the man will come
down to our price, thus keeping himself for
three months out of the interest of his money.
There is some beautiful porcelain, but very
dear. I have never seen any of the rose-backed
plates or cups that are so much prized at home;
and two or three of the dealers, whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span> I have
asked about them, had never heard of such
things. There is plenty of bad cloisonné enamel
about; but the fine specimens came from Yuen-Ming-Yuen,
and the Chinese were obliged to
sell them off as fast as they could for fear of
the law. (I take it the natives had a great hand
in the looting.) I only know of two really
magnificent pieces, for which the owner asks
£1000! He would probably take £300, and
they would be a great bargain at the price.
They are two colossal covered bowls, without
flaw or fault, and would look splendid at
Windsor or some very great house. I have
written to a friend to tell him of them.</p>

<p>The best chance of picking up here and
there a pretty thing is in the minor shops, from
which the bigger ones are recruited. There is
a street called the Liu-li-chang, which swarms
with old book shops (a sort of Paternoster
Row) and curiosity shops, some of which are
hardly more than stalls, where sometimes one
may find a piece of fine porcelain, or other
work of art, for an old song.</p>

<p>I start after to-morrow morning for Ku-Pei-Ko̔u,
to see the Great Wall, and I
shall return by way of the tombs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span> of the
emperors of the Ming dynasty; so at any rate
I shall not have to sing the eternal refrain,
“Peking is very dirty.” I shall be about eight
days gone. The trip was originally to have
been undertaken with the Russian Minister,
but he is detained by business, so I go with
Murray, and we accompany Saurin as far as
Ku-Pei-Ko̔u, whence he will travel into Mongolia,
and Murray and I shall come back.</p>

<p>One more word about the Beggar’s Bridge:
often one of the poor creatures will die at his
post, and I have seen the corpse lie there for
two or three days hardly covered over by a
piece of rotten matting. His troubles and
miseries are over. The beggars are, I am
told, a sort of guild with a recognised head, to
whom it is not an infrequent custom to pay a
slight annual tribute, by which means their
importunities, such as taking up a position
outside a man’s door or shop, and refusing to
“move on,” may be avoided, and their piteous
cry, “Ko̔ Lien! Ko̔ Lien!” (Have mercy! have
mercy!) no longer heard. Begging throughout
Asia is a fine art.</p>

<span class="smcap">Peking</span>, <i>5th September 1865</i>.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I returned</span> on Saturday from my trip to the
Great Wall; I must try and give you some
account of it.</p>

<p>We started on the 25th August, as I told
you before. Saurin and Frater, one of the
student interpreters, were going to make a
journey in Mongolia, and Murray and I accompanied
them to the frontier.</p>

<p>Each party had three servants—a man to
look after clothes, bedding, and things in
general, a cook, and a groom; but besides
these our people took with them <i>their</i> servant,
a queer little oddity of a Chinaman, very dirty,
in an old English sailor’s pea-jacket, much too
big for him, which earned him the name of the
“Skipper.” I never saw such a merry, willing
little creature; he was always at work and
always laughing, as if everything he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span> did were a
capital joke, and the very fact of his being in
the world at all something so ridiculous that he
really couldn’t get over it.</p>

<p>I need tell you little of our first day’s journey,
as far as regards scenery. I had never seen that
part of the plain which lies north-east of Peking,
but it is exactly like the rest, which I have often
described to you. We breakfasted at a place
called Sun-Ho, about thirteen miles hence;
soon after that the country became prettier.
We passed some cosy villages with fine old
willows; from these one is called Ku-Lin-Shu,
the “Old Willow Trees,” and here we stopped
to rest during the great heat of the day at the
tea-shop. As usual, all the people were very
civil and talkative. One elderly man, whose
name was Ma, a Mohammedan, and evidently
the village politician, was very communicative;
he was a great Tory, and <i lang="la">laudator temporis acti</i>,
abusing the present dynasty, and sighing over
the “good old days” of the Mings. I gave him
a cigar, which he took with great delight, and
jumped up on to a little low wall, where he sat
perched with his hams on his heels like an old
bird, and went on with his denunciation of the
Tartars. “Ugh!” said he, “they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span> have not
got a good officer among all their mandarins.
They brought us into the war with foreign
powers, and then when they saw the big men
and the big horses, and heard the poum-poum-poum
of the cannon, what did they do? Why,
they ran away and left us to pay for it all.”</p>

<p>We slept at a place called Niu-Lan-Shan,
near which there are some marshes with herons
and wild-fowl. A Chinese inn is very unlike
our notions of an inn. It is generally built
round the four sides of a courtyard; the guests’
house is at the bottom, facing north and south.
East and west are stalls for mules, horses, and
donkeys; the remaining side is occupied by the
people of the house. The inn-yard is very
animated—carts, pigs, horses, mules, dogs,
flocks of pigeons, and poultry are crowded into
it, besides poor travellers, Chinese and Mongol.
Then there are generally a travelling barber
plying his trade in one corner, a pedlar haggling
for a few cash in another, and all the idle vagabonds
who seem to comprise the greater part of
the population of every place in Northern China,
and who come in to loaf about and make remarks
about the foreigners. There is no great
variety or originality in these. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span> is always
a fugleman, who makes a remark, and then the
crowd take it up in chorus. The following is
really a fair specimen of the sort of thing they
say about us:—</p>

<p><i>Fugleman</i>—“Those boots! They are made
of scented cow’s leather” (Russia leather).</p>

<p><i>Chorus</i>—“Those boots! They are made of
scented cow’s leather.”</p>

<p><i>Fugleman</i>—“Those boots! He that wears
them need not fear water.”</p>

<p><i>Chorus</i> (admiringly)—“Those boots! He
that wears them,” etc.</p>

<p><i>Fugleman</i> (to one of us)—“Those boots!
How much did they cost?”</p>

<p><i>Englishman</i>—“They cost fourteen taels.”</p>

<p><i>Fugleman</i>—“Those boots! They cost
fourteen taels, and he speaks the mandarin
language.”</p>

<p><i>Chorus</i>-“They cost fourteen taels, and he
speaks the mandarin language”—and so it
goes on <i lang="la">ad infinitum</i>. If we are in a good
humour we give the fugleman a cigar, which he
puffs at vigorously, and swears “it is both
strong and fragrant”; but it makes him cough
violently, and he passes it on to the next in the
crowd, until the whole of them retire,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span> coughing
and declaring that it is “both strong and
fragrant,” into a corner, from which every now
and then we hear “those boots” all over
again.</p>

<p>The rooms of the inn are very bare indeed;
the only furniture is a table with two chairs,
and the only <i lang="fr">vaisselle</i> provided is a teapot
and bowls, all guests being expected to bring
their own bedding, food, and comforts. On
each door is pasted a print of a god in staring
colours. The lintels and posts of the inner
doors are covered with characters printed on
red paper, which are generally moral reflections
from the works of Confucius, such as, “All
happiness comes from Heaven,” “To become
wealthy you must have the principle of right.”
On the wall is generally hung a picture. I saw
one of a sage with a forehead like a misshapen
pear, lecturing before two warriors upon the
Yang and Yin (the universal principle of
nature); another of a yellow elephant in spectacles,
his body, legs, and trunk covered with
characters, with two gentlemen in blue eating
their dinner comfortably under his stomach,
while a third was offering a stalk of millet to a
lady in pink, who modestly turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span> her head
aside as she accepted the present; this was a
sort of Chinese farmer’s Moore’s almanack,
indicating the propitious times for sowing,
reaping, etc. Besides the centre picture, the
walls are often covered with drawings by poor
travelling artists, who earn a night’s lodging by
the skill of their pencil. Some of their productions,
when they don’t attempt figures or
beasts, are very clever. I have seen in the
most out-of-the-way inns sketches of bamboo,
grasses, flowers, and birds, that were dashed off
in a way that would have done credit to well-known
names. If the traveller be a poor
scholar, as such are always proud of their caligraphy,
he will, instead of a drawing, contribute
quotations from the philosophers or poets, or a
few verses in praise of the landlord and his
honesty, and declaring how his (the poor
scholar’s) heart had laughed during the period
of their intercourse. Every room has in it a
ka̔ng; this is a large stove about 2½ feet high,
covered with a mat or piece of felt, taking up
all one side of the room, and serving as a bed.
In winter the Chinese, like the Russians, bake
themselves every time they go to sleep.</p>

<p>There came on a fearful thunderstorm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span> in
the night, with a deluge of rain, which gave us
some uneasiness, as we had several rivers
ahead of us which we feared might become unfordable,
as indeed turned out to be the case.
However, the only inconvenience we suffered
was in loss of time, for when we arrived next
morning at the first river we found huge ferry-boats,
worked by strapping Chinamen stark
naked; it took us nearly two hours to get our
carts, mules, and horses across. We amused ourselves
the while in watching a swine-herd’s vain
endeavours to make his flock swim the stream,
the opposition being led by a stubborn little
curly-tail, with a majority in his favour. The
consumption of pork at Peking must be something
fabulous. The streets swarm with pigs,
and yet from every direction we saw large
herds being driven into the town. The Chinese
who can afford it eat pork at nearly every
meal. We found an encampment of Mongols
on the river-bank. They were on their way
homeward from Peking, where they had been
selling horses. They seemed very good-humoured,
honest people, simple and primitive
to a degree, as amused as children with our
watches, clothes, saddles, and other <span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>belongings.</p>

<p>It is very strange, the farther one gets from
the capital, to see an improvement in everything.
The fields are better cultivated, the houses are
better built, and the villages far cleaner than
the town. Fifteen miles out of Peking all
the indecencies and filthiness which are its
characteristics disappear entirely; a man would
be stoned if he were to venture upon outraging
decency as the Pekingese do; the poor peasants
are more polite and less inquisitive about us,
although foreigners so rarely appear among
them, which makes one think that the inquisitiveness
is sometimes only studied impertinence.
We saw several farmhouses with pretty
gardens and neat out-houses, which might have
stood in an English shire, so free were they
from all stamp of China. The people seemed
well-to-do, and the farmers positively rich. We
met a lady going out to spend the day with
her gossip, dressed as smart as a new pin, and
carrying her baby in her arms. She was riding
a donkey, which, as soon as one of our vicious
little Mongol ponies set eyes on, he made a
dash at the ass and upset him and the lady
and the baby, happily on to a bank, for had she
fallen in the muddy lane there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span> would have
been an end to all her finery. As it was, she
was let off for a good fright. “Ai ya! what
manners are these! what manners are these!”
she cried indignantly as she struggled on to
her tiny goat’s feet. We, of course, made all
the apologies possible, and she bestrode her
ass and rode off pacified—more or less.</p>

<p>The principal place that we passed on this
day (August 26) was Mi-Yün-Hsien, a walled
city. We did not enter the city, but skirted
the walls. Outside the gate there stands a
guard-house, and near this there is a tall
blasted tree. It has neither leaf nor sprout,
but from its whitened branches there hang
small wooden cages, and in each cage is a
human head, at which the carrion-birds are
pecking. A ghastly fruit!</p>

<p>At a little place called Shi-ling I saw the
prettiest woman I have ever met in China.
She was a widow, and really looked quite
lovely in her white dress and fillet, which she
wore as weeds. She had a clear olive complexion,
abundance of black hair, dark eyes,
and regular features. Women’s dress in this
country show nothing of the figure; but we all
agreed that she <i>must</i> have had a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>good figure;
alas! her feet had been tortured and deformed.
This is commonly supposed to be the difference
between pure Chinese women and Tartars. As
a matter of fact, I am assured that it is a question
of family custom, some Tartar families
adopting it, while some Chinese families do
not. The poor serving wench who has her feet
deformed must be sadly hampered in her work.</p>

<p>We slept at Mu-Chia-Yu. The next morning
(August 27) we started in good time, for
we wished to reach Ku-Pei-Ko̔u early that day.
Although the ride of the day before had been
very pretty, increasing in beauty as we drew
near to the mountains, I was hardly prepared
for such glorious scenery as we passed through
on this day. The road lay over and between
hillocks and rocks covered with ferns, mosses,
and wild-flowers, and before us were the mountains
with blue distances and fantastic outlines
for a landscape-painter to revel in. Over the
tops of the highest hills the Great Wall of China
traced a zigzag course, like a distant chain. Rich
crops of millet and Indian corn, with undergrowths
of beans or buckwheat, bordered with
the castor-oil plant, stood in the valleys and in
the plain. The cottages of the different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span> villages
had an air of comfort and tidiness rare in China;
almost every one had a little flower-garden
fenced in by a hedge of millet stalks, trailed
over with gourds, convolvulus, and vines. In
some places the people were gathering in the
smaller sort of millet; they were cutting the
ears separately with a small knife, as a gardener
would gather a dish of fruit or vegetables.</p>

<p>The only instance of hostility towards a
foreigner on the part of the people I have met
with hitherto happened on this day. Frater
and I were riding about 200 yards ahead of
the party when, just as we arrived at a crossroad,
and were doubting which way to take, up
came a party of about a dozen Chinamen with
a cart. We, according to good manners, “borrowed
the light of their intelligence,” and asked
our way, which they pointed out, paying us at
the same time the compliment of asking whether
we had eaten our dinner. I think I told you
that the common salutation is, “Have you had
your dinner?” The literal translation of the
phrase is, “Have you eaten rice.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> <i>Rice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span></i> has
passed into the generic term for all meals.
<i>Early rice</i> is breakfast, <i>late rice</i> is dinner.
<i>The rice is prepared</i> is the equivalent of
Mr. Bailey Junior’s “the wittles is up.” In
short, amenity and deportment could be pushed
no further. To our surprise a few moments
after Saurin and Murray rode up looking hot
and angry, and asking us whether we had had
any difficulty with these same men. It appeared
that, as Saurin was riding past the cart,
the man inside, in the most unprovoked way,
struck him in the chest with his brass pipe.
Murray was riding just behind him and saw
the blow struck, and from their account of what
took place I doubt whether the man will ever
insult a foreigner again. His friends all took
part against him, but interceded for him, crying,
“Be calm, be calm; he has had enough.” At
any rate he got a good whipping.</p>

<p>The sun was scorching hot, and it was a
great relief to come upon a pretty village-green,
at one end of which stood a small tea-shop,
shaded by a covering of millet-straw and by a
broad-spreading tree: our horses needed a rest
as much as ourselves; they had been driven
nearly mad by the flies and by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>one venomous
little insect in particular, which must have been
the original gadfly that persecuted Io. It has
a long sheath in its tail, out of which it shoots
a sting into the horses’ flanks, apparently out of
pure mischief, for it never seems to suck them,
and it follows a horse or mule for miles. If
one attacked our horses, the only way to get
rid of it was to dismount and kill it. So sharp
is its sting that every time it touched our
beasts they jumped up as if they had been shot.
We were all glad of a friendly shelter.</p>

<p>We found a party of Chinamen playing
dominoes. They were playing the game more
as we do cards than dominoes, but I could not
make out the principle of it. The landlord was
a very jolly, burly fellow, the picture of a host
with whom everything prospered, although he
must have been poor enough, for instead of
tea he was drinking an infusion of dried leaves
of jujube that is common on the hills. In
some places where there is no tea to be had
the people drink a sort of barley water, and
very good it is. At these tea-shops guests are
expected to bring their own tea-leaves. The
house supplies only the pot and the boiling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
water.</p>

<p>Almost every man and woman (I am not
exaggerating) that we met in this part of the
valley had goitres, not so bad as those one
meets in the Swiss valleys, but far more
numerous. In one village we saw eight fullgrown
men and women only—out of the eight
seven had goitres.</p>

<p>Overlooking the village-green I mentioned
above is a fort commanding the plain; and on
one side of the fort the road has been cut
through the solid rock and arched over with
strong masonry, so as to form a gate, which
bears the legend, “The Gate of the Southern
Heavens.” Through this gate there is a most
gorgeous view of the different ranges, the Great
Wall, and the approach to Ku-Pei-Ko̔u.</p>

<p>Ku-Pei-Ko̔u is in its way one of the most
strikingly beautiful places that I have ever seen.
The valley by which it is reached, with rocks,
ferns, mosses, gardens, and a little rivulet sparkling
in the sunlight, is a gem. The town itself
stands in a little nest among the hills which
surround it; on one side of it runs a river, on
the farther bank of which, in a grove of trees,
is the yamên or official residence of the Ti-tu
(the general officer commanding the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span> district).
There is not a point in the whole place from
which there is not something attractive to rest
one’s eyes on. The streets are clean, the houses
well built, and the shops seem to do a prosperous
business. At one end of the town is the frontier
gate of China; it is strongly guarded, and ingress
or egress without passport is forbidden.
Besides the walls of the city, as a guard against
Mongol tribes, on the river side are two little
ditches that a man might easily hop over, and
two little pieces of cannon which look more
dangerous to friend than to foe. We walked
outside the gate to stand beyond the confines
of China proper. The guard were extremely
civil, the sentry politely inviting us into the
guard-room to drink tea! The Chinese attach
a great deal of importance to Ku-Pei-Ko̔u as a
border fortress. They keep up a garrison of
two thousand men, of whom ten per cent are
Tartars and the rest Chinese.</p>

<p>The inn here is the largest I have been in yet.
The enormous traffic which passes through the
town keeps its business brisk. The landlord
was a Tientsing man, and a man of letters,
having taken the degree equivalent to our B.A.
Degrees in China are conferred by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span> competitive
examination, only a certain number of candidates
being elected each time. The examinations
are held at Peking, and people come from
all parts of the empire to compete. Some time
back an old gentleman aged 100 presented himself
from the south for examination. He received
the degree of B.A. by Imperial favour, and with
it a present of 2 lbs. of gin-seng, which is a
powerful aphrodisiac and tonic. It is from the
successful candidates that the offices of the
empire are filled, and in former days it was the
highest ambition of a Chinaman to pass the
schools in order to qualify himself for office.
Now, however, a race has sprung up of men
who are indifferent to public honours, and prefer
their private advantage. Of these was our
host. Why, he argued, should he go through
all the petty annoyances and humiliations which
inferior mandarins suffer at the hands of their
superiors for the possible chance of rising to
distinction, when he could enjoy certain comfort
in trade? Many people deny the existence of
this feeling among the lettered class, but it
exists nevertheless. Office, both civil and
military, can also be obtained by purchase.</p>

<p>As I was sitting smoking and reading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span> an old
number of a magazine outside my room, the
landlord came up and began asking me many
questions about what I was reading, and why
we read from left to right instead of in columns
from right to left. About half an hour after I
heard him in the inn-yard delivering a lecture
to an admiring audience of grooms, muleteers,
and riffraff, upon the English language, the
point of which was that we wrote exactly as
the Manchus do, who write in columns from
left to right! Seeing me come he borrowed
my book and proceeded to give practical illustrations
of what he had said, holding it upside
down. This exhibition of learning was received
with awe by the gaping crowd. He was a great
character, this same landlord, a confirmed opium
smoker, and being a man of letters, which is
something more thought of here than being of
good birth is in Europe, he had an immense
number of friends and acquaintances of good
standing of whom he was very proud. He
took me into his own little house, which he had
papered completely with the crimson visiting-cards
of his intimates.</p>

<p>Our first object at Ku-Pei-Ko̔u was to get
the seal of the Ti-tu affixed as a <i>visa</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span> to our
passports. All over the provinces of China
the central authorities count as nothing in comparison
with the local; a small mandarin who
would laugh to scorn the seal of the Imperial
Foreign Office will bow to the earth before
that of his immediate superior. Accordingly,
on the evening of our arrival we sent our
Shao-To, the apostle, to the Yamên with our
cards to beg the Ti-tu to grant us his seal.
He came back discomfited, not having been
able even to see an official of any rank.
The next morning, however, he proposed to
return to the charge, and arraying himself
in his best, with his head shaven and his
tail freshly plaited, he ordered out one of
the carts and called upon the skipper to
attend him. Here arose a difficulty: our servants
all declared that the skipper must abandon
his old pea-jacket as unbefitting the
dignity of the situation; he as firmly stuck
to wearing it, but public opinion was too strong
for him, and he was forced to give up his
favourite garment and appear in a dirty nankin
jacket. In spite of the imposing splendour of
this embassy it was fruitless, the authorities
declaring that they had received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span> no special
instructions from Peking, and that without
them they could not grant the seal. This was
very provoking; the seal was necessary to us,
we had a right to ask for it, and we were
determined to have it, the more especially as
if we, holding an official position here, had
foregone our rights, other travellers would
necessarily have had double difficulty in obtaining
it in future. Murray determined to go
himself and demand to see the Ti-tu. He was
shown into a dirty room full of soldiers, and
the Chinese tried to foist a wretched white-buttoned
mandarin upon him as the Ti-tu.
He of course was not to be taken in by this
childish piece of chicanery, and as soon as it
became evident that he knew what he was
about the big doors were thrown open, and he
was ushered with due solemnity into the presence
of the Ti-tu, who made many apologies
for having kept him waiting, and received him
with much ceremony. Murray had the satisfaction
of being served with tea and sweetmeats
by the very impostor who had tried to
pass himself off as the great man! About the
question of putting on the seal the Ti-tu fenced
for a long while. He had <span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>no orders. He
might get into a scrape. What right had we
to ask it? Murray explained the treaty to
him, and he admitted our claim. But no
sooner were the passports produced than he
raised another objection. The seal of the
British Legation was in the centre, that of the
Imperial Foreign Office on the left, and there
was no more room on the left of that again for
his seal—what could be done? His rank was
too high for his seal to be placed below. “Well,”
said Murray, “put your seal on the right of ours,
and then we shall be figuratively between the
protection of the civil and military authorities
of China.” This little bit of nonsense was the
very thing to please the Chinese mind, and the
seal was set without more delay, Murray undertaking
to explain the matter at Peking. “I
know you’ll do it,” said the Ti-tu, “for when
an Englishman promises a thing he does it.”</p>

<p>I mention this to show you how business
is transacted in China. The most important
affairs are conducted with the same amount
of childishness and trickery as our little passport
difficulty with the Ti-tu of Ku-Pei-Ko̔u,
who, be it recollected, is an officer of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>highest rank.</p>

<p>We spent the afternoon on the Great Wall.
The Chinese name for this most marvellous
work is Wan-Li-Cha̔ng-Che̔ng—literally the
myriad-li-long wall. Calculating the li at a third
of a mile, this name would give it a length of
nearly 3400 miles, but the English books estimate
it at 1250 miles. It was built by the
Emperor Shih of the Chi̔n dynasty about 230
years b.c. as a barrier against the northern tribes,
or more probably as an evidence of power. He
was the same Emperor who burnt the books
of the sages, thus rendering himself famous by
two works—one of construction, the other of
destruction. The wall near Ku-Pei-Ko̔u is for
the most part in very good repair, but in other
places it is little more than a heap of rubbish;
where we saw it, it is built of large blocks of
granite, huge bricks and cement, and the centre
filled in with rubble and concrete. It is some
fifteen feet broad and twenty feet high; at
regular intervals are quadrilateral towers about
forty feet high, built of granite with embrasures—some
of these are quite perfect, others in
ruin; wild vines, asparagus, bluebells, low
shrubs, and other plants grow in profusion
among the débris, and the towers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span> are covered
with silver-backed ferns and mosses. For
miles and miles as far as our eyes could stretch,
up hill and down dale, up precipices almost
perpendicular, and over the highest peaks, we
traced the course of the wall; when we thought
we had fairly lost sight of it our glasses would
light on some distant crag carrying it on still
farther. How so much material could have
been got together in such wild and inaccessible
spots is a marvel.</p>

<p>Even without the attraction of the Great
Wall, the height on which we stood would
have been well worth visiting. Range above
range of hills rose all round us; on one side
were the wilds of Mongolia, on the other the
plains of China. At our feet lay the little
town with its absurd fortification and ditches
and cannon, and the river flowing past it. The
mountain view was only bounded by the limits
of our sight.</p>

<p>We lingered long on the wall, looking and
wondering at the beauty of the scene. We
gathered some ferns and mosses, of which I
send you some, and by dint of hardish work,
for it was no light weight to carry under a
broiling sun, I managed to bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span> off a trophy
in the shape of one of the big bricks. I have
got it safe in my room here, after many vicissitudes,
for it was often nearly left behind, and
some day I hope to take it home.</p>

<p>We left Ku-Pei-Ko̔u the next morning, going
our several ways—Saurin and Frater to Mongolia,
Murray and I to the Tombs of the Mings,
which I must tell you about in another letter.</p>

<p>As you interest yourself about Chinese curiosities
and antiquities, I will add a few words
about the Yang and Yin, to which I alluded
in the early part of my letter.</p>

<p>You may have noticed on old porcelain and
other ornaments this device. It is
the symbol of Yang and Yin, the
universal male and female principle of
creation to which everything is referred.
The celestial principle is male, the terrestrial
female; even plants are male and female, without
reference, of course, to the sexual system
of Linnæus; odd numbers are male, even numbers
female. Day and the sun male, night and
the moon female. Parts of the body, the lungs,
the heart, the liver, etc., each have a sex. Sir
John Davis compares with this the Egyptian and
Brahmin mythologies (<i>The Chinese</i>, vol. ii. p. 67).</p>

<p class="right-indent">
<span class="smcap">Peking</span>, <i>25th Sept. 1865</i>.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> my last letter I told you how we went to
Ku-Pei-Ko̔u. We turned homewards (that I
should talk of Peking as home!) on the 29th
of August. I began my backward journey unluckily.
My horse had a sore back, which no
nostrum in the pharmacopœia of a dirty old
Chinese veterinary surgeon could heal in time
for me to ride him, so I had to go in a cart.
Our first day’s journey was back over the road by
which we had arrived as far as Mi-Yün-Hsien,
a distance of five-and-thirty miles—no great
things, to be sure; but the average pace was
three miles an hour; the road was full of deep
ruts, and rendered doubly uneven by rocky
passages and big stones. The carts have no
springs; at every jolt I was banged up against
the hard sides, and by the evening my back
was as sore as my horse’s. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span> ten hours of
a Chinese cart a man is fit for little else than to
be sold at an old rag and bone shop. Misfortunes
never come single; when I arrived at
Mi-Yün-Hsien, jaded and aching in every bone,
the inns refused to take us in; this was of very
small account, for persuasion and threats soon
brought the people to reason. The only cause
they had to give for their reluctance to house
us, was that last year some foreigners had stayed
there, and instead of paying for their night’s
lodging had beaten the landlord when he asked
for his money; such are some of the travellers
who come to these parts, and who defeat all
our efforts to conciliate the people. However,
we convinced the host that we neither wished
to cheat nor to beat him, and he, when he felt
safe on both scores, was willing enough to be
civil. But during the altercation, which had
attracted a great crowd, my pocket-book was
picked out of my pocket, which was a serious
loss, for it contained a heap of notes, rough
sketches, and plans, that I had made on different
excursions, and our passport. We offered
a reward for its recovery, and sent to the Chih-hsien,
or governor of the town, to ask his help,
which he sent in the shape of two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span> officers, who
came and knelt before us very humbly, but
offered no suggestions for getting back my book,
which I shall now certainly never see again.</p>

<p>We had two days’ journey from Mi-Yün-Hsien
to Chang-Ping-Chou. As the road lay
on one side of the highway, the villages were
smaller, poorer, and more insignificant than
any we had come to yet. By the richness of
their crops, the people here ought to be among
the most prosperous, but they are so taxed by
the Government, and bled by the mandarins,
small and great, that they have no chance.
Wherever we went the people were complaining
of their hard lot; nor was this mere talk, for
since our return to Peking there has been a
serious outbreak not far from the part of the
country that we had travelled over. The insurrection,
if it deserved the name, has been happily
quelled, but not before the rioters had done
great damage, making themselves masters of
two small towns; and it was even said that they
had killed the governor of one town, but this
was afterwards contradicted. The affair was
merely an additional proof of the tyranny of the
petty rulers, and the hatred with which the people
regard them. “A town priest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span> and a country
mandarin” are the types of good luck, says the
proverb; for the one is the darling of the women,
the other can feather his nest handsomely.</p>

<p>It is very curious in this country to come
upon roadside shrines just like those one sees
in the “pious Tyrol” and other Roman
Catholic countries. Those which are erected
in honour of the goddess of mercy, Kwang-Yin,
with a babe in her arms, or the Queen
of Heaven, Ti̔en-Hou, are the very counterpart
of the effigies of the Madonna and
Bambino. The majority of these shrines are
faced by a low whitewashed blank wall. This
often is covered by an allegorical design of great
quaintness, in which the dragon plays a prominent
part. The dragon is the principle of
good, and he is engaged in constant warfare
with the serpent or the tiger, who represent
the principle of evil. These battles are a
common subject for the decoration of the blank
walls of shrines. Apropos of the dragon and
serpent, the Chinese have a quaint superstition.
They believe that thunderstorms are created
by the dragon pursuing the tiger or serpent
through the air, hurling bolts and fiery darts
at him. It is very dangerous to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span> stand at open
windows or in an exposed place during a
thunderstorm, for the serpent and tiger are
very crafty, and have cunning ways of dodging
the dragon’s shots, which thus fall on an
innocent head. The tiger, who is drawn as
a vicious-looking cat, with his back up, lives
to a great age; when he has attained his
thousandth birthday, he throws off his teeth
and puts on a pair of horns. The existence of
such fables is not to be wondered at, for there
are old women’s tales everywhere; what is
delightful here is that some of the educated
men really believe in them.</p>

<p>Chang-Ping-Chou was the scene of the great
tragedy of 1860, the death of the English
prisoners from the effects of the barbarities of
their captors. It is a singular fact that the
only one of the mandarins connected with those
murders who is still alive has been disgraced
and banished. The others have died miserably;
one was executed in gaol for contumely to
the Empress, on the very day on which, expecting
his pardon, he had invited his wives and
family to go to the prison and fetch him away;
another was killed, as it is said, by his own
soldiers. The retribution has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span> been complete.
The Sikh soldiers who survived the cruelties to
which they were subjected, and who gave the
account of what had happened, described
Chang-Ping-Chou as a walled city as big as
Tientsing; but this is a mistake; it is a small
walled city, very prettily situated with hills on
three sides of it; on the top of one of these is
a temple which the Sikhs mistook for a fort, as
they easily might. The little town looks prosperous
enough, and appeared to be doing a
brisk trade in coffins (I never saw so many in
any one place in my life) and the water-tight
wicker-work buckets, which are to my mind the
most ingenious production of North China.</p>

<p>The Shih-san-Ling, or thirteen tombs of the
Ming dynasty, are about five miles distant from
Chang-Ping-Chou. It was the burial-place of
those emperors of the dynasty who reigned
after the removal of the seat of the Empire from
Nanking to Peking. The first sign that we
were approaching something remarkable was a
magnificent stone gateway, built of enormous
blocks of stone and standing isolated in the
midst of the plain. This gateway is the finest
specimen of Chinese architecture that I have
seen. Some way beyond this is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span> second gateway
of brick, roofed with the imperial tiles, also
very handsome, and this leads to a large square
granite building, cruciform inside, containing a
colossal marble tortoise, from whose back
springs a marble tablet of great height, bearing
an inscription on both sides, the one relating
how the tombs were built by the Ming dynasty,
the other how they were restored in the reign
of Chien-Lung. This building is surrounded
by four triumphal columns. Next follows an
avenue of colossal figures in marble,—grim
sentries over the approach to the sepulchres.
The figures come in the following order:—Two
lions sitting, two lions standing; two chi-lings
(a fabulous beast which appears once in
ten thousand years, and was last seen at the
birth of Confucius. Chi-ling is the same as kylin,
which we in England misapply to designate the
porcelain and bronze lions with curly manes
which are imported; these latter are called by
the Chinese shih-tszŭ; as you have a pair, I
thought this might interest you), two chi-lings
sitting; two camels sitting, two camels standing;
two elephants sitting, two elephants standing;
two scaled beasts with wings and wreathed in
flames sitting, two of the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span> standing; two
horses standing, two horses resting; two warriors
in full armour, prepared for battle, with breastplates
that reminded one of Medusa’s head, and
carrying swords and maces; two warriors in
repose, their swords sheathed and their hands
crossed on their breasts; four councillors in
their caps and robes of office; four chamberlains.
We passed through this mysterious
assemblage, which was very terrifying to our
horses, and then had about a mile and a half to
go along a ruined stone road, with decayed
stone and marble bridges, before we got to the
tombs. Each tomb is of itself a palace. The
thirteen stand in an amphitheatre of hills among
groves of cypresses and persimmon trees. The
tombs are about three-quarters of a mile apart.
The plain is cultivated now, but evidently
it was originally intended that the whole place
should be silent, solitary, and secluded.
Nothing can be more beautiful than the situation.
As I told you once before, in this country
the fairest spots are chosen for burying the
dead, and you may suppose that the emperors
of the magnificent Ming dynasty would not be
behind their people in this.</p>

<p>The tomb which is generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span> visited by
strangers, and which I saw, is that of the
Emperor Yung-Lo; it is the oldest and <i lang="fr">par
excellence</i> “the Great Tomb.” The Emperor
Tae-Tsung, who reigned under the style of
Yung-Lo, was the third of his dynasty; he
reigned during the first quarter of the fifteenth
century. It was he who moved the capital from
Nanking to Peking. Of the thirteen emperors
of his dynasty who succeeded him, twelve are
buried round him; the thirteenth, who, when
Peking was taken by the rebels, committed
suicide in his harem after killing his wives and
children, with the exception of one daughter, is
missing.</p>

<p>The Tomb-Palace is, of course, surrounded
by a high red wall tiled with yellow, the
imperial colours. A broad and handsome
entrance gate leads into a large courtyard; on
the right is a pavilion containing a marble
tortoise carrying a high marble slab with a
commemorative inscription. Past this court is
a vast entrance hall. Two flights of steps
lead up to the hall, and between them
is a slant of marble richly carved and ornamented;
I believe that this centre path is for
the good spirits to walk along.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span> A second
courtyard contains two beautiful little yellow
shrines, both empty. A triple terrace of marble,
with steps and slants as before, precedes the
grand hall, a most imposing chamber. It is
81 paces long by 36 broad, and very lofty.
The floor is of black marble, the walls a dull
yellow; the roof, which is fretted and painted
like cloisonné enamel with dragons and other
emblems, is supported by thirty-six huge
masts of wood, smoothed but unpolished, and
all of equal size. They are marvellously handsome,
and in this country (where wood is so
precious that an empty house is not safe for a
night from thieves, who will strip it of roof,
doors, and windows) must have cost something
prodigious. In the centre of the hall is rather
a mean shrine in honour of “our ancestor
canonised under the name of Wên.” Every
emperor passes through three names. First
he has his own name, which, after he ascends
the throne, is never used nor borne again, for
he then assumes the style of his reign, and at
his death is canonised under a third. So this
Emperor’s name was Tai-Tsung; he reigned
under the style of Yung-Lo, and was finally
canonised as Wên. After this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span> grand hall
come two more courtyards; in one of these
stands a great sacrificial altar of stone and
marble. The top block of marble is eight
paces long; on this altar are placed the five
gifts—an incense-burner, two candlesticks, and
two pots of fruits. Inside the altar is a tank of
fresh water, which is got at by passing a stick
with a piece of linen attached to it as a sponge
through a hole in the side. This water is a
specific for certain complaints. The last building
is a high tower, with a vaulted passage
springing off into two directions. I never
heard such an echo as this produced; we two,
as we walked along, made a noise like that of
a regiment. From the top of the tower, which
contains a large perpendicular slab of marble
painted red, there is a beautiful view over
the country, with the thirteen palaces of the
dead each in its niche in the hills; it is really
a scene of rare and striking beauty. Just
behind the tower is an artificial mound covered
with trees and verdure; this, I believe, is where
the body lies—a few old bones to all this
magnificence. There is a Chinese proverb
which says, “Better be a living beggar covered
with sores than a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span> dead emperor.”</p>

<p>As we were sitting over our dinner at the
inn we both agreed that as it was a lovely
moonlight night we would go back at any rate
as far as the avenue of colossal statues. I
never saw anything so weird as the big beasts
and warriors looked; they almost seemed to
move in the moonlight—one half expected one
of them to come down from his pedestal, like
the Commendatore in <i>Don Giovanni</i>, and
punish us for the intrusion. It is impossible
to imagine a wilder or more lonely spot; it is
really the solitude of the tomb.</p>

<p>The next morning at daybreak we rode
into Peking, about 25 miles. I have seen
nothing so interesting since I have been in
China as the scenes of which I have tried to
give you an idea.</p>

<p class="right-indent">
<span class="smcap">Peking</span>, <i>25th October 1865</i>.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I who</span> so lately wrote to you about blazing
sun and scorching heat am now glad to nestle
into the chimney-corner and watch the “pictures
in the fire.” Outside, the rain is falling fitfully
and the wind blowing a hurricane; it moans
and howls dismally through the courts and
cranky buildings of the Legation, piercing its
way into all sorts of odd nooks, and routing out
old bells that jangle in a harsh and discordant
way from the quaint eaves, as if they were angry
at being disturbed in their dusty dens. Doors are
creaking and timbers groaning in every direction,
and the windows threaten to burst in, but
the stout Corean paper holds good, though it
gets stretched and flaps unpleasantly like loose
sails in a calm, and on the whole I confess I
prefer glass. Every now and then, as the storm
abates for a while, I hear the tap, tap,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span> tap, of the
watchman’s bamboo as he goes his rounds, and
can’t help grunting with Lucretian satisfaction
as I look at my fire and think of how cold he
must be. In short, we are working gradually
into winter. In another fortnight the trees will
all be bare, and Peking, throwing off the green
clothes which it puts on in summer, in order
to delude stray visitors into the idea that it is
a pretty place, will stand naked, dirty, and
ashamed. The last month has been very
pleasant—neither too hot nor too cold; and
the early morning rides, before wind or dust
has arisen, and when the evil smells of the
town, which are beaten down by the night
dews, have not had time to assert themselves
again, put fresh life into us after the great heats.
I have got a new horse. The first one which
I bought in the spring turned out to be possessed
of every vice to which horse-flesh is
heir; so I sold him at a loss, after he had
bored my life out for four months, and am now
well mounted on a first-rate Mongol cob.</p>

<p>Talking of horses leads me to dogs. I have
had a sad loss in my little dog Nou-nou, of
whom I was very fond. I told you what a
little Turk he was, always getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span> himself into
scrapes about his amours. Well, the other day
he had some words with a big dog belonging
to the sergeant of our escort, which ended in
his getting a bite in the back that broke his
spine and killed him. Everybody in the Legation
regrets him, poor little beast; he had been
at Peking ever since the foreign Legations
first came here, and was quite a character about
the place. I was very much grieved at his
death.</p>

<p>We have been interested lately in the steps
taken by the Russian Government to establish
a telegraph from Kiachta to Peking and
Tientsing. The Russians wish that it should
be a Chinese enterprise, but that they, the
Russians, should set it up and help in working
it. Accordingly, they have sent an officer of
engineers here with a complete apparatus to
show the Chinese Government. It is set up
in the gardens of the Russian Legation. Some
four years ago, when Baron Gros returned to
Europe, he sent out to the Prince of Kung a
present of an electric telegraphic apparatus.
Such was the horror which the Chinese then
had of innovations, that the Prince not only
refused to accept it, but even <span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>to see it. Now,
however, the Government is more ripe for
taking impressions from abroad. The members
of the Foreign Office, and afterwards the Prince,
have been to see the machine work, although
the Prince took good care not to allow that his
visit had any special purpose, and with that
view went the round of all the Legations the
same day. He watched the working of the
telegraph without showing any great astonishment
or perception of what was going on; but
a few days afterwards M. Vlangaly, the Russian
Minister, who had drawn up for the Prince a
paper upon the subject of the international
utility of telegraphs, received a very satisfactory
despatch from the Foreign Office to the effect
that one visit was not enough to enable the
Ministers to appreciate so wonderful an invention,
and that they hoped to be allowed to
see it again. M. Vlangaly has had the happy
idea of having some intelligent Chinese lads
taught to work the telegraph, so next time the
Prince comes he will see that his own people
can learn to send off and take down messages.
This is all a great step in advance. The French,
who are always on the look-out to find that
other Powers are extending their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span> “influence,”
as they call it, and in this case have the
additional motive for jealousy in the refusal of
Baron Gros’ present, look upon this move of
the Russians with great distrust and dislike.
We, on the contrary, are all for supporting any
Power who will help the Chinese to move
forwards. The superstitions of the people
would be a great difficulty in the way of carrying
out telegraphs, railroads, or any great
engineering project in China. They would
view with the utmost horror anything which
might disturb places deemed sacred, lucky, or
unlucky. They have a regular system for
determining propitious places, manners of building,
and the like. This they call “Fêng Shui,”
the wind and water system, and it is universally
believed in. No Chinaman, however educated,
would inhabit a new house without ascertaining
that it fulfilled all the requirements laid down
in the books which treat of “Fêng Shui.”
Some time ago one of our men was ill; our
chief teacher, a man of great learning as Chinamen
go, said quietly to Wade that it must be
owing to a new chimney which had been built
opposite to the sick man’s room, but about a
hundred and fifty yards off.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span> Any work which
might be undertaken here must be carried out
with all respect to the “Fêng Shui,” or it
would run the risk of being destroyed. Graves
and other sacred places must also not be interfered
with. In carrying any engineering project
into execution, the best plan would be for
the engineer to lay down his line and employ
Chinese experts in such matters to see how
nearly it could be followed.</p>

<p>I have rather a good story to tell you. One
of our subjects of complaint at the Chinese
Foreign Office has been our being insulted
in the streets of Peking by the riffraff of the
place. Their means of annoyance is to howl out
“Kwei-tzŭ” (devils) after us when our backs are
turned, and then, of course, to look as if they
had not done it. Well, the other day M. de
Mas, the Spanish Minister, being about to
leave Peking, exchanged compliments p.p.c.
with all the members of the Foreign Board.
Amongst them all Hêng-Chi distinguished himself
by his <i lang="fr">empressement</i>, sending M. de Mas
a magnificent dinner <i lang="fr">à la Chinoise</i>. M. de Mas
went to thank him, and after the two old gentlemen
had exchanged banalities to their hearts’
content, the Spaniard knowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span> that Hêng-Chi
had a little son, the child of his old age, of whom
he was inordinately proud, thought it would
be a very pretty compliment if he asked to
see the little boy, who was accordingly produced,
sucking his thumb after the manner of
his years. Him his father ordered to pay his
respects to M. de Mas—that is to say, shake his
united fists at him in token of salutation, instead
of which the child, after long silence and much
urging, taking his thumb deliberately out of his
mouth, roared out “Kwei-tzŭ” at the top of
his voice and fled. Imagine the consternation
of the two old twaddles! Hêng-Chi was horrified,
for after all his protestations of friendship
to us, which by the bye took nobody in, it
bored him not a little that we should find out
that his child was brought up in the privacy
of his harem to look upon us as devils.</p>

<p>A French missionary has been murdered in
the province of Ssŭ-Chuan, in the extreme west.
It is said that there are 800,000 Christians in
the province. There have been persecutions
and disturbances on their account of late, and
the Government of Peking will have to take
very active steps in the matter, or the French
will be down upon them. The central<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span> Government
are always slow in punishing their provincial
authorities, whom they fear; and in this
instance they will be the more reluctant, as the
governor of the province is a man who has
done them good service as an administrator.</p>

<p>We hear rumours of reforms in China. If
the present dynasty is to be preserved and
China to remain independent, they must be
brought about quickly, for the moment is
critical. Nothing can be more rotten and
corrupt than every branch of the administration,
nothing can be more faithless than the
conduct of the Chinese towards foreigners.
With misery and discontent at home, and angry
reclamations for breaches of treaty from abroad,
the Government are beginning to tremble for
their existence. If the remedy does not come
soon it will be too late.</p>

<span class="smcap">Peking</span>, <i>5th November 1865</i>.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> awakened this morning by such a
noise of squibs, crackers, petards, maroons,
bombs, cannon, and all manner of fireworks,
that I rubbed my eyes and was half inclined
to fancy that some good fairy had transported
me back to England, where Guy Fawkes’ day
was being celebrated on a scale of unprecedented
splendour. Not, however, that fireworks
are a matter of astonishment here—they
are going on at all hours of the day and night;
our opposite neighbour, the Prince of Su, is
continually letting off pieces which, to judge
from the noise they make, would make the
bouquet at Cremorne look very foolish. Fireworks
and sweetmeats are the favourite dissipation
of the Pekingese; the ladies especially
take great delight in them, burning and sucking
away immense sums. To-day Peking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span> out-heroded
itself: never was heard such a fizzing,
cracking, popping, and banging; for this is
the seventeenth day of the ninth moon, and
although the Gunpowder Plot was never heard
of here, and if it had been would not have produced
any extraordinary sensation, still it is an
occasion upon which every devout and proper
Chinaman is bound to burn as many squibs as
he can afford, or more; for the seventeenth day
of the ninth moon is the birthday of a certain
little pousa or god, by name Tsai-shên. Now
this little god is a very great little god, being
intimately connected with tradespeople, and
especially with their profits; and as tradespeople
here are very numerous, and all have
a natural weakness for profits, a great many
crackers and squibs are expended to do this
little god honour and service—of course <i lang="fr">à titre
de revanche</i>; moreover, scraps of paper upon
which are written or printed characters of good
omen are burnt and scattered to the winds.
Furthermore, this little god having been during
his lifetime on earth connected with the Mohammedan
religion, it is also a matter of decency to
eat and invite him to eat mutton all day, for
pork would evidently be an insult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span> to him,
while beef would be a deep personal affront
to Buddha, but mutton satisfies all parties, including
the eaters, provided that they have
enough of it. I have mentioned this because
it seemed to me noteworthy that at the two
ends of our hemisphere the same day should
this year be from different causes celebrated
somewhat in the same way.</p>

<p>The little Emperor leaves Peking to-day for
the Tung-Ling, the tombs of the emperors of
this dynasty. He goes to place his father’s coffin
in the tomb which has been prepared for it,
and which has taken four years to build. It is
a great state occasion. The Emperor will be
accompanied by the Prince of Kung, and all
the court and chief ministers, with the exception
of Wen Hsiang, who is the real Minister for
Foreign Affairs. He remains to take charge of
the capital. I shall be able to tell you nothing
about the procession, for on these occasions
the members of the Legations receive an official
notification not to show themselves in certain
streets between certain hours. Indeed, the
whole thing is conducted within the city with
as much secrecy and mystery as the Princess
Badroulbadour’s procession to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span> bath in the
<i>Arabian Nights</i>; shops are closed and shutters
put up, and the streets are cleared along the
line of march, for there is no saying what harm
might happen to the state if a citizen of Peking
were to catch a glimpse of the outside of the
chair in which his Emperor is being carried.
The consistency of the Chinese in this as in
other matters is remarkable, for once the cavalcade
is outside the city walls any lout may go
and gape at it. The public gains one advantage
from these Imperial progresses. The roads
over which His Majesty is to pass are repaired,
for it would never do for Imperial bones to be
shaken and Imperial eyes offended by such
roads as are good enough for “the hundred
names” (which is the Chinese expression for
the common people).</p>

<p>The Chinese-Mesopotamian treaty was
signed on the 2nd instant, and I must say
that the Chinese come uncommonly well out
of the affair. They had already concluded a
treaty with Mesopotamia at Shanghai, and had
received no notification that the King of that
country had refused to ratify it, when all of a
sudden a gentleman appeared this summer
announcing himself as plenipotentiary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span> sent by
the King to conclude a treaty, nothing being
said of the former one. The Chinese, after
some discussion, named two plenipotentiaries,
and offered M. T&NoBreak;—— his choice of any existing
treaty. He, however, said, “A quoi bon
envoyer un négociateur s’il ne doit pas négocier,”
and sat down to compose a treaty on the principle
of an amateur opera, out of four others.
However, as the history of the treaty would
not amuse you, it is enough to say that the
Mesopotamian showed himself to be <i lang="fr">plus
Chinois que les Chinois</i>, while the Chinese
exhibited a pliability and a willingness to
accept innovations which took us all by
surprise. The treaty is an affair of very
small consideration; there has occasionally
been a Mesopotamian ship seen in the Chinese
seas, and there is one Mesopotamian subject
in China who was declared bankrupt during
the negotiations. But the conduct of the
Chinese, as showing a desire to amend in their
foreign policy, is of the last importance to us.
They have shown in these negotiations that
they have read their translation of Wheaton’s
<i>International Law</i> with profit, and they have
departed from old precedents in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span> a way which
was enough to make the old conservatives’ tails
stand on end.</p>

<p>The great difficulty with the Chinese has
been their foreign policy. Their internal affairs
would right themselves if they would accept our
civilisation and our standard of official probity.
But if they are to preserve their independence
they must learn to keep faith with foreign
nations and meet honesty with honesty.</p>

<p>Although in our recent dealings with the
Chinese they have shown better faith and
more loyalty than before, we have still many
crows to pick with them. Breaches of treaty
are endless. One of the articles upon which we
insist the most is that which provides that a
British subject offending against the Chinese
law shall be handed over for punishment to the
nearest consul. The Taeping rebellion has
attracted to its ranks a vast number of rowdies,
many of them deserters from the Imperialist
army. If these men were caught and left to
the mercy of the native authorities, it is fearful
to think what their fate would be. We are at
this moment trying to rescue one man from
their clutches, and investigating the case of
another whom they reported <span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>to have died a
natural death while being taken to Shanghai;
but as the report was not made until six weeks
after his death, we suspect treachery. The
central Government shows every disposition to
help us, but governors of provinces are strong,
and they know it. No stone, of course, will be
left unturned to get back the living man (if
indeed he be still alive), nor to exact retribution
for the death of the other, if there should
be proved to have been foul play. It is not yet
all rose-colour, you see.</p>

<p>We have no news yet of the mail of
10th September, which brings out our new
chief, Sir Rutherford Alcock. I was to have
gone to Tientsing to meet him, but I fancied
the river journey would be rather cold;
and I am very glad I did not go, as I
should have been dangling about Tientsing
all these days, not knowing what to do
with myself. In the meanwhile we are busy
preparing for his reception. I am already in
my new house, which is rather pretty, with a
great deal of Chinese carved woodwork, but
eminently adapted for catching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span> rheumatism.
It will cost me something to make it wind-tight.
I hope, however, by degrees to make it comfortable
and cosy.</p>

<p>I am in a state of philological orphanage.
My first teacher, Ku, left me to go into some
small office—office, however small, being dear
to every Chinaman; my second, a most charming
person, was caught stealing a dollar off my
table. The man was really such a pleasant
companion and such a good master that I
rather wished to ignore the whole thing; but
my servant Chang-Hsi represented that if Hsü
Hsien Shêng remained he could be responsible
for nothing that was lost, and so I had to pack
off poor Hsü. He was a perfectly inexhaustible
fund of anecdotes, proverbs, folk-lore, and
Chinese small talk, so different from the ordinary
run of Chinese teachers, whose only idea
of broaching a conversation is to ask some
preposterous question about one’s “honourable
country.” If he could but have kept his hands
from picking and stealing!</p>

<span class="smcap">Peking</span>, <i>25th November 1865</i>.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are sending off a mail to-day in the
hopes that it will yet be able to leave Tientsing
for Shanghai before we are finally shut out by
the frost from communication with the outer
world. After this our posts will be rare and
uncertain, going by land to Chihfu and thence
on. The winter has well set in; we have had
several sharp frosts, which, although they are
child’s play to what I have seen in Russia, are
aggravated by cutting winds which blow clouds
of dust, pricking one’s face like flights of
needles. Nothing can be more bare and
desolate than this city, now that it is stripped
of its leaves. Everything looks gray and
black, and the Chinese houses have a poor,
pinched appearance that to English eyes,
accustomed to see a cheerful fire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span> blazing in
even the poorest cottages, is very shivery.
The natives are already swaddled up in furs
and wadding, and commend me to a cold
Chinaman for looking wretched. Their yellow-brown
faces get perfectly livid and corpse-like
under the effect of the cold winds, a great
contrast to the tanned and sturdy Mongols
who are beginning to flock into the city. The
life in the streets is changed too by the innumerable
droves of Bactrian camels with
double humps that are pouring in long streams
of merchandise.</p>

<p>One great advantage of this time of year is
in the improvement of our larder. In summer
we are obliged to ring the changes on tough
beef and stringy mutton; now we have plenty
of game—hares, several sorts of pheasants, wild
duck, teal, snipes, and other birds innumerable.
Soon we shall have varieties of venison, amongst
them that of an antelope of Mongolia which the
Chinese call Hwang-Yang, “yellow sheep,” said
to be the daintiest venison in the world. Of
fruit we have plenty; there is a certain small
apple-shaped pear, by far the best I ever tasted.
Grapes we have every day in the year, so that
nature does as much for us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span> as Mr. S——’s
gardener does for him. To be sure, the gardener
beats nature hollow as to quality.</p>

<p>The <i>Peking Gazette</i> has just announced an
appointment in the Chinese Foreign Office (the
Tsung-Li Yamên), which is said to be the most
important event, as far as foreign relations are
concerned, that has taken place since the signature
of Lord Elgin’s treaty. A mandarin of
the name of Hsü has been named one of the
high Ministers of the Office. This man some
years ago was in high office in the province of
Fohkien, and while there, he, with the help of
certain American missionaries, wrote a work on
the geography of the world, in which he examined
foreign institutions and men with an
interest which no Chinaman had ever before
shown. His two favourite heroes were Napoleon
and Washington. The book was written
in a popular form, and had a large sale. After
he had been in office three years he came to
Peking to pay his respects to the Emperor, and
during his visit was degraded on the plea that
he had not conducted his government well, but
really on account of the new views put forward
in his book, and of his admiration and intelligence
of foreign affairs. Now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span> for the very
qualities which before brought him into disgrace,
he is raised to the dignity of a red
button of the third rank, and appointed to a
vacancy in the Board of Foreign Ministers, which
was made this spring by the dismissal of a mandarin
named Hsüeh, who was degraded on
account of his being suspected of attempts to
bribe the Prince of Kung at the same time that
His Imperial Highness was also out of favour.
Hsü’s acceptance of office is looked upon as the
beginning of a new era in our intercourse with
the Chinese.</p>

<p>Sir Rutherford Alcock has reached Tientsing
after a series of disasters. He came in a
man-of-war from Shanghai, disdaining the
regular steamers, and the consequence is that
everything has gone wrong, the last mishap
being the loss of the Legation treasure outside
the bar at Taku, with 18,000 dollars. The
sailors managed to upset the chest into the sea
as they were transhipping it into the little
steamer which was to bring it up the Peiho.
There is a rumour that divers have recovered
the chest; if it is true, I think they deserve all
its contents for their pains. The weather is not
exactly suited for diving.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span> Meanwhile the
Legation courtyards are being flooded with
carts and packing-cases containing furniture,
pianos, harmoniums, and games of croquet; the
latter will be hard to use, for there is not a
blade of grass nearer than the park round the
Temple of Heaven.</p>

<span class="smcap">Peking</span>, <i>4th December 1865</i>.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> messenger who brought us in the welcome
mail of the 26th September also told us that
there was still a chance of catching a vessel at
Taku, before the final freezing of the Gulf of
Pechili—the river, of course, is long since
closed—so here goes for the last account of us
before we are shut up.</p>

<p>Sir Rutherford Alcock arrived here last
Wednesday with his family. They had a
terrible journey of it; three days from Tientsing
in sedan chairs, sleeping in inns without fires,
and only paper windows in different degrees of
bad repair.</p>

<p>We are enjoying the <i lang="fr">beau idéal</i> of winter
weather. We have had one fall of snow, which
has left its traces in the shade and on the north
side of the house-roofs; everywhere else it has
disappeared under a sun which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span> at mid-day is
always genial; the sharp frosts of the night
and early morning keep the ground as hard as
iron; the air is perfectly delicious, and for many
days we have not been visited by our chief
curse, the wind, which comes tearing down
from Mongolia to choke and blind us with dust.
This weather, fine as it is, comes very hard on
the beggars, who go about stark naked, livid
with cold. The filth of the furs which the
poorer Chinese wear surpasses belief. It is a
common sight to see the sunny side of a wall
occupied by half a dozen of the natives who
have deliberately stripped themselves and are
eagerly hunting after the vermin with which
they swarm. The principal streets are crowded
with sellers of cast-off clothes, rags that would
be rejected by a respectable paper factory.
They toss these about, singing a sort of monotonous
rhythmical chant all the time, after the
manner of Chinese hucksters, and they do a
thriving trade in filth.</p>

<p>We had an offer the other day of purchasing
a plant that would make a man immortal if he
ate it; as we had no desire any of us to undergo
the fate of Tithonus at the price of 5000 taels,
nearly £2000, we let it slip through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span> our hands.
It was brought to us by a drug merchant, who
said that he had found it in the mountains of
Manchuria, and he produced a Chinese botanical
work in support of his statements. The plant
was a small black toad-stool; he called it the
“tree of life,” and said that it was only found
once in a thousand years. We asked him why
he did not sell his treasure to the Emperor; he
replied that he would do so were it not for the
way in which he would be bled by the palace
officials. When, however, we asked where the
last man who had eaten of the tree of life was
to be heard of, he left in high disgust at our
unbelief. The Chinese ideas of natural history
are always very curious. Some days ago one
of the wandering curio-sellers came to me with
a beautiful little crystal snuff-bottle of what
they call hair crystal, from the black veins like
hair which run through it, and he thought it
necessary to explain how the hair got into
the crystal. “You see,” said he, “as your
Excellency knows, we Chinese did not always
shave our heads as we do now. In the time of
the Ming dynasty our people used to wear their
hair long, but when the Tartars usurped the
throne our people were all forced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span> to shave their
heads. Accordingly they threw their hair
which they had cut off into the sea. There
the waves and the rays of the sun, combining
their influences, acted upon this hair and produced
the effect which your Excellency admires.
But it was only in rare instances that the influences
happened to coincide, and no man
could of his own will, and by cutting off his
hair, depend on its being turned into hair
crystal.”</p>

<p>The Emperor’s journey to bury his father
has been made the opportunity of rescinding
all the decrees disgracing the Prince of Kung
last spring. They are to be blotted out from
the records of the Empire, so that future ages
may know nothing about them.</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> arrival of the mail last night brought
the old year to a happy termination, but, alas!
Saurin is to leave us for a German post. My
batch of letters was doubly welcome, it was so
long since I had heard from home, and may be
such an age before another mail comes up from
Chefoo; as for the newspapers, they bring such
stale news now that they are hardly worth
plodding through. We get the pith of the
news by the Russian post and telegraph to
Kiachta, so reading the <i>Times</i> is like being
gifted in a small way with the power of prophecy,
and shows what a very tame affair life
would be if we could foresee the future. Our
papers are still speculating on Lord Palmerston’s
actions next session, and three weeks
ago we heard the news of his death.</p>

<p>This morning I was awakened <span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>by a procession
of all the Chinamen about the Legation,
who came to bend the knee before me and wish
me joy for the New Year. I hope all their
good wishes, with mine into the bargain, may
be realised for You.</p>

<p>Although it is a long time since I last wrote
to you, I have little enough to say. Sir Rutherford
and Lady Alcock have settled down in
their new quarters. I think they are rather
disappointed, and no wonder; but they seem
determined to make the best of everything,
and to try and make every one comfortable
about them. Sir Rutherford’s first interview
with the Prince of Kung passed off very well.
I never saw the Prince so gracious. The
Chinese Foreign Office, the Tsung-Li Yamên,
is almost as bad a place for receiving in as our
old building in Downing Street.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> In order to
be met at the great gates, which on grand
occasions is <i lang="fr">de rigueur</i>, we have to pass into
the reception-room through the back kitchen,
where we see all the little dainties which we
are to eat being cooked by very dirty natives.
The reception-room is a sort of octagonal glass
pavilion in the middle of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span> courtyard, a
wretchedly cold place. However, the Chinese
are independent of cold rooms, for they don’t
take off their furs (the fur of foxes’ legs is the
official dress), and they wear boots so thick
that they cannot feel the cold stones of the
floor. Of course a building so exposed is as
hot in summer as it is cold in winter, so in
this climate of extremes a visit to the Chinese
Foreign Office is never very pleasant.</p>

<p>I should tell you that the Tsung-Li Yamên
is really a board of high officials, all of whom
hold other functions, which was created after
the treaties of 1860 for the conduct of foreign
affairs. There is no titular Foreign Minister.</p>

<p>One bright cold morning, about a fortnight
ago, three of us witnessed a Chinese execution.
The place of execution is at the opening of the
vegetable market in the Chinese city. The
market is held in a broadish street, into which
a number of large thoroughfares, at right angles
to it, lead. All these inlets were fenced off,
and the street itself filled with soldiery and
officials; such a tatterdemalion crowd! with
nothing resembling uniformity of dress except
the Tartar cap, and that, in many cases, was torn
and battered, and tassel-less. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>The men were as
heterogeneous as their clothes. Old and young,
strong and decrepit, half blind or whole deaf,
none seemed too miserable objects for service.
I saw one effective soldier on crutches; hunchbacks
and cripples were in plenty. We left our
horses in charge of some of these poor devils,
and walked through the lines, no one opposing
us, but, on the contrary, every one showing us
the utmost civility. The whole of the shops in
the street were closed, but the flat, low roofs
were crowded with spectators; among them not
a single woman or child was to be seen.</p>

<p>At one end of the space closed off was a
matting shed. Inside this were the condemned
prisoners, who were waiting for the Imperial
decree for their death to be brought on to the
ground. We went in, and I shall not easily
forget the scene. There were fifteen criminals,
of whom one was a woman, one was a murderer;
two, of whom the woman was one, had stolen
girls and sold them into the worst of all
slavery; the rest were highway robbers. The
murderer was to be decapitated, it being a severe
punishment to a Chinese not to take his body
out of the world as his parents gave it to him.
(It is this feeling that makes them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span> so averse to
amputation.) The others were all to be
strangled. It is very strange to be talking
with men who are to die within a few minutes.
Some of them were perfectly calm and
collected, and came up to talk with us and
ask us questions, as if nothing was the
matter. One bright, intelligent-looking fellow
came up to me and said, “Well, I suppose
you’ve come to see the fun.” The word he
used was the same that would be employed
to signify the fun of a fair. “Do you have
this sort of fun in your country?” another said
laughingly. “I wish you would take me off
with you.” We said we should only be too glad;
on which he smiled and said, “Ah! the law
won’t let you do that.” One very old man could
not forget his Asiatic politeness, even <i lang="la">in articulo
mortis</i>. One of our party had asked a guard
for a light for his cigar. The guard either did
not hear or did not pay attention; on which
the old fellow touched him and said, “What
manners are these? don’t you see the gentleman
wants a light.” All, however, were not so
quiet. The murderer was raving and ranting
drunk, howling out every obscene blasphemy
that he could think of against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span> the Emperor.
The woman had been charitably given some
drug, which, though it had made her very sick,
had deprived her of consciousness. Nothing
could exceed the kindness of the officials, one
and all, to the condemned men. They were
giving them smokes out of their pipes, tea, and
wine; even the wretched murderer, who was
struggling and fighting between two soldiers,
was only asked to “be quiet, be quiet,” in spite
of all provocation. The others were walking
about the booth, their hands tied, and a sort of
arrow stuck behind their backs, bearing their
name and the crime for which they were to
suffer, but otherwise uncontrolled. They were
all from one part of the country. I told you
that the woman had been drugged. This is a
constant practice at executions. The most
famous drug for this purpose is the blood from
under the red crest of the crane, called by the
Chinese “Ho ting hung.” This, or a medicine
purporting to be such, is sold at an immense
price, and is said to be carried by mandarins in
one of the beads of their necklaces, in order
that if they incur the Emperor’s displeasure,
they may have the means of death at hand, for
the crane’s crest-blood is a poison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span> as well as an
anodyne. We gave all the cigars we had with
us to the poor condemned criminals, who were
very grateful for them, and I was glad to leave
so painful a scene. A little farther down the
street another large booth had been erected.
Here sat the high officials in a semicircle, with a
red-button mandarin from the Board of Punishments
at their head. On one side of this booth
was a tiny sort of altar on which were displayed
the tools of the executioner—the swords and
bloody string, and the tourniquets and strings
for strangling. In front of the altar a small
brick stove had been built, over which was a
caldron of boiling water, like a huge barber’s pot,
to warm the swords. The executioner’s men
were huddled round it toasting their hands.
The swords are short broad blades, almost like
choppers, with a long wooden handle on which
is carved a grotesque head. They have been
above two hundred years in use, and are regarded
as genii and invested with preternatural
powers. They are five in number, and their
names are Great Lord, second Lord, third
Lord, fourth Lord, and fifth Lord (Ta yeh,
êrh yeh, san yeh, ssŭ yeh, and wu yeh). When
they are not in use they are kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span> at the chief
executioner’s house, a tower on the wall, where,
as my teacher gravely informed me, they are
often heard at night to sing gruesome songs of
their past feats. When they are wanted their
Lordships are “requested” to come out.</p>

<p>The executioners have all sorts of stories
and traditions about them. One is supposed
to be younger than the others, and of a skittish,
frolicsome nature, dallying and toying with the
heads, not striking them off at one blow like
the others, who are older and more sedate.
There were many false alarms that the decree
had come and announced the fatal moment.
But at last the chief headsman (Kwei-tzŭ-shou)
came out, and throwing off his fur coat put
on a bloodstained apron of yellow leather. He
was a short, thick-set, but not ill-looking man,
with that curious, anxious, <i>waiting</i> expression
on his face that a man wears with serious
work before him. It was horrid to see how
completely he was the hero of the occasion,
the soldiers round him treating him with the
greatest deference, and evidently proud of a
word from him. The five swords were carried
in line near him. His assistant stripped his
outer coat, and then all was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>ready. So soon
as the decree arrived the prisoners were led
out one by one to the booth where the mandarins
were sitting, and there made to go
through the form of acknowledging the justice
of their punishment. They were then handed
over to the executioner. The headsman and
his men had to beat back the other soldiers
with sticks in order to clear a space. Nothing
could be more indecent and revolting than the
behaviour of the latter. All order and discipline
were at an end; they were like hounds
yelling, snarling, and struggling to tear a fox
in pieces rather than men ostensibly employed
to keep the peace. The murderer was the
first man brought forward. Happily he had
raved himself into a state of insensibility, so
his pains were over. The decapitation is done
with marvellous speed. A string is passed
round the prisoner’s neck, close under the chin,
and his head is thus held up by the assistant
so as to offer resistance to the sword. When
a mandarin is executed, the headsman meets
him and says, “Ching ta jên kwei ti̔en,” “I
pray that your Excellency may fly to heaven”—much
as our executioners used to ask the pardon
of their victims. The man is made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span> to kneel, in
an instant the sword is raised, the executioner
gives a shriek supposed to represent the words
“I have executed a man” (Sha liao jên), and at
one blow the head is severed from the trunk
and carried off to be inspected by the mandarins.
As the blow falls the people all cry
out, “A good sword” (hao Tao), partly in
praise of the headsman’s skill, but more especially
from a superstitious feeling <i lang="de">um berufen</i>.
The strangling is done with the same merciful
quickness. It is far less lengthy than hanging.
Two pieces of whip-cord are passed round the
neck with a loop. The criminal is placed with
his face to the ground, and the two executioners
turn the tourniquet as quick as thought.
Apparently there is no suffering. As I passed
the big booth on my way out—for you may
imagine that when I had seen how the matter
was conducted I stayed for no more—I heard a
loud voice shout out a name. Immediately out
of the shed where the rest of the condemned
were waiting, I saw a tall man walk out between
two others as leisurely and composedly
as if he had been going to his dinner. It
was one of the young fellows with whom I had
spoken so short a time before.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span> The last act
of this horror is consummated in the <i>Pit of the
10,000</i> (Wan Jên K’êng) by the wolves and
foxes, a pit in the Chinese city where the
bodies of executed criminals are thrown. Rich
people’s bodies are bought back by their families
that they may receive decent burial.</p>

<p>I was glad to see that the execution was
conducted far more mercifully than one is led
to suppose by certain writers. It is true
that this is not the “Ling Chih,” or disgraceful
slow death, which is the punishment
of parricide<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and high treason. But an Englishman
who has witnessed that assures me
that the criminal he saw so executed was put
out of his misery at once, and that the mutilation
took place <i>after</i> death and not before.
I was specially struck by the excessive kindness
of the soldiery to the criminals. The
only sign of cruel disposition was the eagerness
with which they pressed forward to see
the death. That <span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>was revolting.</p>

<p>Of all the men who died that day not one
appeared to be in the slightest degree affected
by the solemnity of his position, or to show any
apprehension for what was to follow. Where
there was any emotion it was simply abject
terror of the immediate pain of dying. Beyond
that their thoughts did not seem to penetrate.</p>

<p>I must bring this letter of horrors to an end.</p>

<span class="smcap">Peking</span>, <i>20th January 1866</i>.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> I last wrote we have all been leading
the lives of vegetables in our own garden; with
a skating rink inside the Legation there is no
excuse for facing the wind and dust outside.
We have the greatest difficulty in keeping up
our rink. The wind blows the dust on to the
ice in clouds, and the hot sun melts it in, so
that nothing but constant flooding will keep
the ice going. This has been an unusually
dry season even for this driest of climates, so
much so that a few days ago a decree appeared
in the <i>Peking Gazette</i> directing five princes of
the blood to proceed to different temples, and
offer up incense, and pray for snow. The
Emperor had a cold, or he would have gone
himself. The <i>Peking Gazette</i>, by the way, is
a very curious little publication. It appears
daily in the form of a small pamphlet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span> and is
sold for a trifling sum. It is said to have been
first published in the time of the Sung dynasty,
about seven hundred years before its brother of
London was born at Oxford. It contains the
movements of the court, Imperial decrees,
petitions, memorials and the answers thereto,
appointments, promotions, rewards, etc. Some
of the announcements are very amusing. I
give you one or two specimens. Some months
ago, at the storming of a town which was in the
hands of the rebels, at the very moment when
a mine had been sprung, Kwan-Ti, the god of
war, appeared in all his majesty (it don’t seem
quite clear who saw him), and by his presence
so encouraged the Imperialist troops that they
rushed into the breach with an ardour which
carried everything before it, and sacked the
city. In gratitude for this, at the request of the
high officials of Shan Hsi, the Emperor directs
the officers of the Han Lin (Imperial college)
and of the Nan Shu Fang (private Imperial
library) to prepare a tablet to be erected in
some temple in Shan Hsi to commemorate the
divine interposition. Notice is sent by the
authorities of Cheh Kiang to the Board of
Ceremonies and Rites that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span> widow in those
parts, being in uncontrollable grief for her
husband’s death, and resolved to preserve her
fidelity to him, has committed suicide. Posthumous
honours are awarded to her for her
great chastity. (To commit suicide on the
death of her husband is the highest virtue
which a Chinese wife can show. The streets
of Peking are in many places crossed by wooden
triumphal arches called Pai Lo in honour of these
chaste matrons. It would seem, however, rather
as if this extreme chastity were dying out, for I
don’t know one of these arches that is not in
the last stage of decay.) A taotai, governor of
a city from down south, has come up to Peking
on business connected with the sulphur trade.
Having finished what he had to do, he reminds
the Government that his father was killed some
years ago in the rebellion in Shan Hsi, and
his body never recovered. He represents that
the old gentleman’s bones weigh heavily upon
him and make him feel very uncomfortable,
and he suggests that the Government might
send him on a special mission to Shan Hsi to
try and recover these same bones, paying his
expenses as a matter of course. The Government,
in reply to this, praise his filial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span> piety, enter
into his views about the bones with enthusiasm,
encourage him by all means to try and
find them, but positively decline to open their
purse-strings. Posthumous honours, canonisation,
or deification, are often recorded in the
<i>Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>Old Hêng-Chi is the officer of the Tsung-Li
Yamên charged with negotiating a new
commercial treaty with the Russians relative
to the Siberian and Mongolian trade. Whenever
he is going to be particularly obstructive
he sends po-po (sweetmeats) to the
Legation. Now I suppose he is going to play
the Russians some <i lang="fr">tour pendable</i>, for he sent
a whole feast both to the minister and secretary
of Legation. It was very prettily arranged;
the decoration of the dishes and piling of the
sweetmeats in patterns must have cost the cook
a world of trouble. I think I once before gave
you an account of a Chinese feast given by the
same old gentleman, and I daresay you don’t
wish a repetition of the account any more than
I do of the feast, though the things are not bad
once in a way. The bird’s-nest soup was
very good, though it owes its flavour to the
condiments with which it is dressed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span> the nest
itself being as tasteless as isinglass, which it
much resembles.</p>

<p>My teacher the other day gave me some
original views as to the outbreak of cholera
which took place a few years ago. Various
causes were assigned for it. Some said that the
epidemic was caused by the exhalations from the
dead bodies of those who were killed in the Ta̔i
Pi̔ng rebellion; others, that offence had been
given to Wên Shên, the spirit of pestilence, a
deity who is represented with a blue face and
red hair and beard. He carries in his hand a
disk, a spear, a sword, or some warlike weapon.
A man who has fallen into misfortune is said to
have met Wên Shên. To be “as ugly as the
Lord Wên Shên” is what we should translate
by “to be as ugly as sin.”</p>

<p>We had rather a good piece of fun the other
night. One of our ladies of the <i lang="fr">Corps diplomatique</i>
has started Thursday “at homes,” and
all the Europeans in Peking congregate there.
Last Thursday some one or other sat down
and played a valse, upon which a tarantula bit
the only two ladies, and they declared they must
and would dance, so Pichon, the French attaché,
and I were told off as partners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span> for them. Just
as we were spinning round the room, in came
three or four Chinese servants with trays of
cake and hot wine, which I thought they would
have dropped, so stupefied were they at the
sight. I don’t think I ever saw astonishment
so written on faces before. I can fancy them
talking about it afterwards—Ai yah! There
was his Excellency Mi (that’s me) and Pi Lao
Yeh seizing the two Ku-niangs (young ladies)
round the waist in the most indecorous manner,
and running round and round the room with
them, while O Lao Yeh beat the harp-table.
Indeed it was unsurpassable! Strange people
these barbarians!</p>

<p>Saurin and I had a visit from Mr. Thomas
the day before yesterday. He is famous in
China as the converse of St. Matthew, having
left the Church to go to the Customs. Mr.
Thomas is a linguist of some pretensions. He
speaks several European languages (including
Russian), Chinese, Japanese, and Mongol. He
came out about two years ago as a member
of one of the Missionary Societies, but
quarrelled with his brother missionaries because
he had the good sense to refuse to preach in
Chinese after being three months <span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>in the country.
He then entered the Chinese Customs service,
and was stationed at Chihfu when I passed by
there in May last. However, he has now returned
to the flock, and is living with the other missionaries
at Peking. Mr. Thomas has just returned
from a trip to Corea, which he undertook for
purposes of linguistic research, and we were
greatly in hopes of hearing something about
that <i lang="la">terra incognita</i>. While Mr. Thomas was
at Chihfu he was able to be civil to two Corean
merchants who had gone there to collect debts.
They were Christians, and brought open letters
with them from the Roman Catholic mission
at Saoul, the capital of Corea, entreating any
Christians whom they might fall in with to
treat them kindly. Mr. Thomas took them to
live with him, and commenced studying Corean
under their auspices. When they were about to
return to their own country Mr. Thomas accompanied
them. He appears, however, to have
seen little or nothing. His landings were but
for short walks, principally on islands along the
coast. He reached a point of the coast 25
miles from Saoul, to which he intended to
have gone in the disguise of a Corean in
mourning for his father and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>mother, the face
completely covered by a long veil, loose white
clothes hiding the body, the costume being
completed by a hat with a brim about a yard
and a half in diameter. The wreck of his
Corean junk prevented his effecting his purpose
(possibly luckily for him), and he was obliged
to return to China in a Chinese junk; so he
underwent incredible hardships from hunger
and dirt, and great danger from shipwreck, to
little purpose; what he acquired of the language
must have been through his two friends, and
he can give no account of the people, who
must be a curious race. Not only are they so
exclusive that they forbid foreigners to enter
their country, but they prevent their own people
from leaving it, as the Japanese did; only
certain privileged persons are allowed to come
to China with tribute to the Emperor or for
trading purposes. There are plenty of these
in Peking at the present moment; they are distinguished
by their high hats and peculiar type;
any Corean not belonging to this guild who
left his country would be decapitated on his
return. It is strange that, notwithstanding this
rigid exclusiveness, the Roman Catholic missionaries
seem to live undisturbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span> at Saoul, where
they are said to have made many converts.
They are obliged, however, to wear the Corean
mourning so as to hide their faces, and conform
to the habits of the country.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The most important part of Mr. Thomas’
tale is a report that 250 Coreans have gone
over the Amoor, and tendered allegiance to
the Russians. Of course Russia will have
Corea sooner or later, but I think that if this
report were true we must have heard of it from
other sources.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> mail day has come round again very
quickly, so I am in hopes that you are getting
letters more regularly than I had led you to
expect. If the wonderfully warm weather we
are enjoying now lasts, the river must break
up soon, and then we shall have regular mails
again. On the 30th of January the thermometer
stood at 40° Fahrenheit at midnight.
The Chinese are in great glee; after having
consumed infinite amounts of joss-stick in praying
for snow, and sent out princes of the blood
to shiver in distant temples, and all in vain, the
Emperor went out one morning to pray on his
own account, and on that very morning the
snow came. We took advantage of what has
turned out to be the last of the frost, for the
present at least, to make an expedition to Yuen-Ming-Yuen
and skate on the lake.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span> It was such
a bright, pretty scene—the lake was as clear as
a sheet of glass, and the ice perfectly transparent—not
very good for skating, though, for
the lotus plants do not quite lie down. However,
every now and then we came upon a
hundred yards square of marvellous ice, uncut
by skates and free from dust. A number of
Chinese came to look at us; figure-skating
astonished them immensely, especially anything
done going backwards. Some of the natives
skate after a fashion, but they are generally
contented with tying a skate on to one foot and
pushing themselves along with the other. It
is said that skating used to form part of the
Manchu bannermen’s drill. We picnicked in
one of the little pavilions in the garden, and
very jolly we were.</p>

<p>I went a few days ago, for the first time, to
visit the Russian missionary establishment (the
head of which is the Archimandrite Palladius),
in the north-east corner of the Tartar city. It
is surrounded by a large open space; the air is
fresh; there is no dust, and above all there is immediate
egress into the country without having
to cross miles of filthy streets. It is such a pity
that the Legations were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span> established up
there in 1861. The mission consists of three
priests besides the chief; there is a day-school
for twenty-four children, whose parents are all
Christians; indeed, the Archimandrite told me
that the neighbouring population were almost
all converts. The Russians have altogether a
large congregation here, an important element in
which are the Albazines. The Albazines were
originally a small colony of Russian labourers,
who settled at the little town of Albazin on the
Amoor. In the time of Alexis, father of Peter
the Great, the Chinese made war upon this
little colony, and after a desperate resistance on
their part, which lasted about two years, conquered
them and took prisoners those whom
they did not kill. On account of the great
bravery which they had shown, the survivors
were carried to Peking and made to serve as
soldiers. Here they have lived to the present
time, having become Chinese in everything
save in the matter of their religion, which they
have faithfully preserved. From father to son
they have been forced to serve as soldiers, and
allowed to select no other career. It is only
recently that a decree has been issued
emancipating them from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span> this rule, and
permitting them to follow trade, labour, or letters.
There are probably not more than ten or
fifteen pure Albazine families left; but as they
have intermarried freely with the Chinese and
Christianised their women, they largely swell
the Greek congregation. The carrying off of
people on both frontiers has been an old standing
quarrel between China and Russia. It was
to settle questions of this sort that Peter the
Great sent an embassy to the Emperor Ka̔ng-Hsi.
This embassy was the foundation of the
two Russian missions, that of the south being
the present Legation, and that of the north the
Church mission. The southern mission was
used by the merchants of the caravans which
used to arrive from Siberia once in three years,
to transact business between the two countries;
it has been recently rebuilt, all except the
chapel, which dates from Peter’s time, and
which still bears the marks of an earthquake
which occurred in the middle of the last century.
The Archimandrite told me that when
he first came to Peking twenty-five years ago
there was no more difficulty in holding intercourse
with the people than there is at present.
The priests of the mission could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span> not go beyond
the Great Wall in one direction, nor as far as
Tientsing in the other; but this was owing to
the mandarins, who always were, and probably
always will be, obstructive. The people were
friendly enough; those who did not know them,
seeing strangely dressed figures with fair beards
and hair for the first time, took them for
Manchu Tartars; so even now it often happens
that we Europeans are taken for Mongols by
the Chinese who have seen neither race.</p>

<p>I was talking the other day to my teacher
about Lord Palmerston and his wonderful
strength of body and mind. He was greatly
interested, and cited two instances in Chinese
history of statesmen who were flourishing and
vigorous after eighty years of age. The first
case he mentioned was that of the minister
Liang, who, in the reign of the Empress
Wu-Tseih-Ti̔en of the Tang dynasty (seventh
century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>), obtained the highest literary
degree, and became premier at the age of
eighty-two. The second case he cited was
more legendary.</p>

<p>Wên Wang, father of Wu Wang, the first
Emperor of the Chou dynasty (and a contemporary
of Saul, King of Israel),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span> dreamt a dream,
and in his dream he saw a beast that was like a
boar and yet like a man, and it had wings and
flew. Now when he awoke he was sorely
troubled in his heart, because he could not read
the meaning of his dream; so he sent for the
court seer, and the court seer told him that
the interpretation of his dream was, that he
should have a wise and crafty councillor. When
Wên Wang heard this, he immediately sallied
forth in his chariot to seek for this wise man,
and he took with him his two sons. After
many days he came to a river called Wei-Shui-Ho,
and by the side of the river was an old
man fishing. The name of this old man was
Tai Kung, and during the reign of the wicked
Emperor Chou-Hsin he had lived in a cave in
a mountain, cultivating learning. When Wên
Wang saw the old man he told his sons to
descend from the chariot and ask him the road.
But the old man went on with his fishing,
and answered them, saying, “Behold the
little fishes have come to me, but the big
fish stops away.” Now when this oracular
answer was told to Wên Wang he immediately
knew that this must be the wise
man that was promised to him <span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>in his dream, for
the old man’s saying was a reproach to him
that he had not himself gone down, as manners
required, but sent his sons instead. So Wên
Wang invited Tai Kung to get into his chariot,
and he carried him off and made him his chief
minister. At that time Tai Kung was eighty
years old and more. When Wên Wang died
Wu Wang treated Tai Kung with the honours
due to a father, for it was by his wise counsels
that the dynasty became strengthened in the
kingdom. He lived to nearly a hundred years
of age, and at his death he became a spirit, and
many say that he is now the captain of all the
spirits, and assigns to each his particular place
and duties.</p>

<p>The above is a word for word translation
of the story of Tai Kung as my teacher told
it me.</p>

<p>The student interpreters gave a second
theatrical representation on Monday. The
pieces were “Our Wife” and “To Paris and
back for £5.” To my mind the most amusing
part of the entertainment was to watch the
faces of the Chinese servants at the back, who,
not understanding a word, were deeply interested
in the performance, and said that it
was very beautiful, especially the first piece,
in which the makeshifts for Louis XIII.
dresses charmed them much. The ladies
stood on an average 5 feet 10 inches in their
stockings, and had blue marks where whiskers
and beards had been shaved off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span> in the morning;
but in spite of all drawbacks, everybody
agreed that there never had been and never
could be such a success—which has always
been said of every private performance I ever
witnessed.</p>

<p>No one could believe that we are ice-bound
here. Yesterday the thermometer at 2 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>
stood at 84° in our courtyard; at eight in the
morning it had been down to 22°, a difference
of 62°! The Chinese complain bitterly of the
heat. The Emperor was to go again to pray
for snow to-day, and the <i>Peking Gazette</i> publishes
an article from one of the Imperial
advisers, stating that the want of snow must
be ascribed to the anger of heaven on two
accounts: 1st, undue severity on the part of
minor officials in the Board of Punishments;
2nd, the number of bodies killed in the rebellion
and still lying unburied.</p>

<p>What thieves these mandarins are! Some,
time ago when the Ti̔en Wang (Prince of
Heaven), the chief of the Ta̔i Pi̔ng rebellion,
poisoned himself, his son fled carrying with him
his father’s great seal, which, on his capture, was
carried to the Emperor at Peking. The seal
was a huge affair of massive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span> gold with two
dragons on the top. Its value was about £600.
When the Emperor had seen it, it was handed
over to the Prince of Kung and the Grand
Council, and by them deposited under lock and
key in the council office, the watching of which
by night is confided to certain high officials.
When the turn of night duty fell to one Sa, a
man of good family and a mandarin of the
fourth button, the seal was missing. There
was a great hue and cry, and all the wretched
servants in the office were carried off to the
Board of Punishments, where they were tortured
<i lang="la">secundum artem</i>, the real thief Sa being quite
above suspicion. Meanwhile he carried off the
seal to a goldsmith’s shop in the Chinese city,
telling him that he had received orders from
the palace to have it melted down. The man
undertook the job and put the seal into the
melting-pot; but the two dragons, being harder
than the rest of the metal, would not melt, so
they were put on one side to wait till a hotter
fire could be prepared. As luck would have it
a friend of the goldsmith, who had heard of the
loss of the seal, came in, and seeing the two
dragons, smelt a rat, and laid an information.
Sa was tried, found guilty, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span> strangled in the
vegetable market. He was a well-to-do man,
and his family were rich people, so the money
was not needed. But a little peculation, however
small, is dear to a mandarin’s heart.</p>

<p>Sa was not a master of his craft; he had
not sufficiently considered the eleventh commandment,—most
important to a Chinese
official.</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> last letter to you was dated 8th February,
on which day the festivities of the Chinese
New Year began with the feast of Tsao, the
god of the hearth. This, of course, is inaugurated
with popping of fireworks and banging
of cannon. Tsao is of all the spirits the
one most intimately connected with the family,
and every year, eight days before the New
Year, he goes to heaven to make his report.
Now as in every family there must always be
some little secrets which it is not desirable
should be known in heaven, it is essential
that something should be done to prevent
Tsao’s tongue from wagging too freely, so
offerings are made to him of barley-sugar, that
his mouth may be sticky! At the same time,
upon either side of his niche, which stands in
the kitchen, are pasted posters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span> of red paper,
the one bearing the words “Go to heaven and
make a good report,” the other “Come back
to your palace and bring good luck.” The
niche is then burnt, and the god rises to heaven
to come back on New Year’s Day, against
which time a new niche is prepared for him.</p>

<p>As the New Year approaches, the principal
amusement in the streets is flying kites. These
are admirably made, and represent all manner
of birds, beasts, and fishes. There are some
which even represent centipedes, but I have
not seen those. In the tail of the kite is
placed a sort of Æolian harp, such as I once
told you the Chinese attach to their pigeons.
I cannot tell you what a strange effect these
weird-looking monsters humming high up in
the air present. The Street of Lanterns, too,
begins to make a great show. Lamps of every
variety of shape, from a bouquet of flowers to
a fiery dragon, are exposed for sale and bought
in quantities.</p>

<p>On New Year’s Eve the houses are cleaned
up and put in order. Characters of good omen
are pasted on all the door-posts; from the
window-sills little strips of red paper stamped
like lace flutter in the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>wind. An altar is
erected in the courtyard with candles and
offerings, while crackers and fireworks are let
off all night to chase away all the evil Spirits
that have been about during the year, and
especially the Spirit of Poverty.</p>

<p>The 15th of February was the Chinese New
Year’s Day. It was a bright, fine day, and the
people were all figged out in the best raiment
available, either from their own wardrobes or
those of the pawnbrokers, whose chests must
have been emptied of every article of smart
clothing for the occasion. All the shops were
shut, but not empty; for from many of them
there issued the most infernal clatter that ever
stunned human ears. I looked into one, my
curiosity getting the better of my manners, and
there I saw a number of respectable middle-aged
<i lang="fr">bourgeois</i> sitting in a circle, and each with
a clapper, gong, cymbals, or drum, beating
for dear life with the gravest of faces. This
was exorcising devils, and, if devils have ears,
ought to be a successful plan. The streets are
full of people paying complimentary visits to
their friends, a ceremony which is nowhere so
universally observed as in China. Outside
the Chien Mên, one of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>gates leading from
the Tartar into the Chinese city, is a small
yellow-tiled Imperial temple to Kwan-Ti, the
god of war. This is crowded with worshippers
on New Year’s Day. High and low flock to
pay their respects and draw their lot for the
year. Outside the temple were a couple of
priests doing a brisk trade in tracts and joss-sticks.
Armed with a bundle of the latter,
which are whisked about in flames, to the great
peril of European beards, the devout advance
and perform the ko̔to̔u before the altar with
three kneelings and nine knockings of the head.
They then draw nearer to the altar, and from a
sort of cup which stands upon it draw at random
a slip of bamboo with certain characters upon it.
This is exchanged according to its inscription
for a piece of paper which is handed to the
votary for a few cash by an attendant priest, and
which contains his fortune for the year. The
people who took part in this ceremony were
excessively devout in their demeanour; there
was no symptom of levity or indifference; they
were imploring the protection of a divine being
for the coming year, with superstition if not with
piety. The richer worshippers were making
offerings of pigs and sheep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span> as sacrifice.</p>

<p>I don’t recollect whether I ever mentioned
to you the Liu Li Chang, a street of booksellers
and curiosity shops, and one of my favourite
lounges here. It is one of the lions of the New
Year. A very amusing fair is held there. It
is perfectly thronged with people, and a very
gay scene. Toys and artificial flowers are the
best things sold; some of the former are capital.
Lifelike models of insects, tiny beasts and birds,
tops, kites of all shapes, and above all some little
figures of European soldiers and sailors—caricatures
of the late war—that were irresistibly comic.
One man was selling a capital toy—two little
figures, jointed, and so contrived that by pulling
a horsehair which is not seen they begin to
fight and go through every motion of desperate
wrestling. There were some jugglers, but
rather a low lot. One man was having bricks
smashed on his head—a somewhat alarming performance,
for which, however, he seemed none
the worse. Then there was a combat between
sword and spear, after the manner of Savile
House in old days, which ended in sword
getting a kick in the stomach and a poke in the
ribs, which well earned a sixpence. A peep-show
represented views <span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>taken in China and
Europe, of which the exhibitor was as ignorant
as his audience: he described St. Paul’s Cathedral
and the Bay of Naples as places of repute
in the Lew Chew Islands; and I really should
be ashamed to tell you what was painted on the
reverse of the view of St. Paul’s. A temple of
the Chinese Æsculapius in one corner of the
fair was crowded with visitors, who were pressing
round the stall of a venerable gentleman
whose stock-in-trade was a bushel or two of
teeth and a picture representing the treatment
of every variety of disease in diagrams. The
teeth he had extracted were mostly sound!
Fortune-tellers were casting up chances, and
wise men reading destinies in all the courts,
which were piled high with votive tablets from
grateful patients. As to the walls, the tablets
on them were three deep. The crowd were uniformly
civil to us, but oh, the garlic of them! It
was high jinks for the beggars, who were more
than usually offensive and pertinacious, especially
the women with sick babies, who would
insist on wishing one a Happy New Year in
every key. It’s no use being pitiful, for if you
give to one you will have a tail of a hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span> at
your heels.</p>

<p>The New Year’s festivities last for a fortnight
or so; it is an endless succession of
feasting and fireworks until the Feast of Lanterns,
twelve days after New Year’s Day. The
latter is quite a bright scene with all the lanterns
and transparencies, but it sounds much more
than it is.</p>

<p>I must tell you something about the Chinese
travellers who are going to Europe, and whom
you will see or hear about. Mr. Hart, the
Inspector-General of Customs, is going home
on leave, and the Chinese Government have
ordered his Chinese secretary, with his son and
three young Chinamen, students of European
languages, to accompany him. Pin Chun, the
gentleman in question, has been raised to the
Clear Blue Button, third grade, and made an
honorary chief clerk in the Foreign Office on
the occasion. His son has been made a clerk
in the Foreign Office. It is a great pity that
the Chinese did not choose a more intelligent
and younger man than Pin Chun, who is sixty-four
years old, and a shocking twaddle. He
and his son are, from what I have seen and
heard of them, quite incapable of forming just
appreciations of what they will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span> see. Then, for
their first mission to Europe, although it has
no official character, they should have chosen a
mandarin of more importance than Pin, whose
reports will have but little weight with the
lettered class of Chinese; indeed, these are
jealous of his promotion, and consider that his
distinction is too cheaply earned. The reason
of Pin’s having been chosen is that he is a
connection by marriage with one of the ministers
of the Chinese Foreign Office. He is said to
be very popular in Pekingese society, so at
any rate, when he comes back, what he has seen
will be talked about in the “highest circles”;
and he is personally acquainted with the Prince
of Kung, who proposed the mission to him at a
wedding breakfast. Pin has no official character
as envoy. He is told to travel and write
down all about the “hills and streams” of the
countries he visits, and he will be trotted about
to every object of interest. I only hope that
he will not be too much lionised. It would be
misinterpreted here, where people would say at
once, “See what great people we are; when a
private traveller among us goes to your country
he is received with the respect which you know
is due to a superior intelligence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span> but your
barbarian ministers even are not received here,—of
course our Emperor is great and powerful,
and you are only here on sufferance.”</p>

<p>I must leave off. I am just starting to
Tientsing to see Saurin off, alas! and when I
come back it will be to almost entire solitude.</p>

<p>Perhaps I have spoken rather too slightingly
of Pin Chun’s mission. It is a small
thing in itself, but we all look upon it as the
first step towards permanent missions in Europe
and better relations here.</p>

</div>

<p class="right-indent">
<span class="smcap">Peking</span>, <i>12th April 1866</i>.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> going to tell you about an entertainment
at the house of a Chinese mandarin. You
will have gathered from my former letters to
you that we see nothing of the Chinese in their
own houses; their life and habits are a sealed
book to us. We only see the mandarins in full
dress and with the mask they wear in conference.
It was a great pleasure to me, therefore,
to make the acquaintance of a Chinese gentleman
of good position, who is so far enlightened
above his fellows as to like and even seek the
society of Europeans, and learn what he can
from them. Yang Lao Yeh is a mandarin wearing
a blue button of the third grade; he is
nominally on the staff of the officials of the
Board of War, but his private fortune of some
ten or twelve thousand pounds a year makes
him independent of his office,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span> except in so
far as his social rank is concerned (for, as
you know, in China, to hold office is to be a
gentleman). I became acquainted with him
through the Russian Legation, with which he
has had intercourse for some three years or
more, and he invited a party of us to his house
at the time of the Feast of Lanterns. He
occupies a large house in the Chinese city.
We went to him at about eleven o’clock in the
morning. As he had not expected us quite so
early we spent half an hour in going over the
premises. I had never before seen the interior
of a Chinese gentleman’s home; I imagined,
however, that Yang’s would be a very favourable
specimen of a rich man’s house. It is
very pretty, with innumerable courtyards round
which the dwelling-houses are built. The
principal court surrounds a small artificial pond,
in the centre of which is a sort of glass summer-house
approached by two little miniature
bridges with tiny white lions of white marble
guarding them at intervals. Rockeries, which
are a very favourite garden ornament, caves,
grottoes, and turrets with battlements, all on a
Liliputian scale, are crammed wherever there is
room, in a most picturesque<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span> defiance of order
and architecture. The only attempts at flowers
and shrubs are a few of the famous dwarfed
trees, trained so as to represent with their
branches characters of good omen, such as
Happiness, Longevity, etc. A broad terrace
walk surmounts the whole. But besides having
the most perfect luxury <i lang="fr">à la Chinoise</i>, Yang is
a great amateur of all European inventions.
He has a room fitted up after our fashion, and
his whole house is full of guns, telescopes,
clocks, barometers, thermometers, and other
foreign importations. He has even gone so far
as to fit up a photographic studio, and takes
lessons in the art, which he practises with considerable
success. He gave us really capital
portraits of himself of his own execution.
When we had wandered all over the house
Yang led us into the private apartments where
breakfast had been prepared for us. Here he
presented to us his son, a very small boy of
sixteen, but a white-buttoned mandarin, nevertheless
(of course the rank had been purchased;
in China both civil and military rank can be
bought). The ladies of the family, resplendent
in silks and satins of many colours, and painted
so that not a particle of <i>themselves</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span> was visible,
were separated from us by a curtain through
which they kept continually peeping, anxious to
see, and not unwilling to be seen. We were
joined by two mandarins, one from the Board of
Punishments, the other from the Board of
Revenue, both very cheery and talkative. The
breakfast was by far the highest effort of
Chinese culinary art that I have yet seen; a
certain marinade of venison, especially, was
beyond praise. Being asked to eat with chop-sticks
always rather reminds me of the fable of
the fox who invited the stork to dinner, and
makes me appreciate the feelings of the stork
on that occasion; but Yang had provided forks,
so we were able to eat on equal terms with our
entertainer, who, apropos of chopsticks, told us
a story of a courtier who was so expert with
that utensil that when a grain of rice once fell
from the Imperial lips he caught it between his
sticks as it fell, for which feat he was on the
spot promoted to high office and emoluments.</p>

<p>The only fault of the breakfast was that
there was too much of it, and as we were perpetually
being pledged by our host and his
friends in warm wine of the headiest nature
(no heeltaps), matters were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span> beginning to look
serious, when happily the dishes were cleared
away and tea was brought. I thought the
eating was all over, but not a bit of it: it was
only a pause in our labours; for in came a huge
and delicious tureen of bird’s-nest soup and
pigeons’ eggs with cream of rice in bowls to
drink—excellent, but stodgy,—and so a Chinese
feast goes on all day without a halt. We witnessed
an instance of the duty which a Chinese
son shows to his father; for not only did Yang’s
son not sit down to dinner with us, but he waited
at table like a sort of upper servant, handing
his father’s pipe, and anticipating all our wants.
Amongst other things which he forced upon us
was a bottle of Curaçoa, which much delighted
the Chinese guests. I ought to have mentioned
that before breakfast began, a company of acrobats
made their appearance to perform in the
yard. The contortionists were two women
and four little girls. The band, which hardly
stopped clashing during upwards of three hours,
consisted of a gong, two pair of cymbals, and
a single kettledrum, beaten by men. The performance
was chiefly rope-dancing and tumbling;
the tricks were not in themselves as good as
what we see daily in the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>streets of European
cities, but the difficulty of them was enhanced
by the performers all being small-footed. The
elder woman was amazingly strong. Lying on
her back she balanced tables, chairs, and other
heavy objects on her feet as if they had been
feathers, and wound up by taking a large wine
jar into which a little girl had been put, like
the forty thieves in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, and
tossing it about on her tiny goat’s hoofs in the
most alarming manner. Whenever a trick was
reaching its climax, the band, indefatigable and
painfully conscientious, beat away vigorously,
making the morning hideous with their <i lang="la">charivari</i>.
To rest the women, who then took their
places at the musical instruments, the men
began to show off some juggling tricks. It
was a mean performance, however, the tricks
being all of the commonest and most transparent—such
as the production of bowls of
fishes, flower-pots, etc. The best trick was the
waving of a sort of whip of paper twelve yards
long and four inches wide, attached to a short
stick. This the performer brandished and
flourished in all directions, making the paper
assume all manner of graceful shapes: now it
was a snake crawling in huge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span> coils along the
ground, now a spiral column like Donato the
one-legged dancer’s scarf, now a series of hoops
through which the juggler skipped backwards
and forwards. This was a very exhausting
exercise. During the performances a rather
amusing dialogue was carried on between the
old man of the party and a small boy who acted
the part of Mr. Merryman, steadily refusing to
believe in the possibility of the tricks announced.
The acrobats were not paid their fee all at once,
but instead of giving applause for any particularly
successful exertion, Yang would send
them out money, and as we, according to
Chinese custom, did the same, they received
a plentiful largesse. One point of contrast
between rope-dancing in China and in Europe
is its decency. The women all wore their
heavy winter trousers and loose jackets fastened
at the waist by a sash—a costume which shows
no outline of the form.</p>

<p>We stayed with Yang until three in the
afternoon. I believe he had expected us to
spend the night in his house; but the entertainment
was becoming wearisome; besides, the
Chinese do not understand our ideas of comfort—paper
windows, thorough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span> draughts, stone
floors, and hard benches explain why they wrap
themselves up in wadding and furs, and wear
boots an inch thick in the soles. They are far
behind the Turks in these respects. I, for one,
thought a night in the Chinese city rather too
much of a good thing, and was glad to make
my bow. Our host, his son, and his Chinese
guests, who, by the bye, had at an early hour
gone off to a back room to enjoy a pipe of
opium, came to the outer gate to see us off,
and we parted with many expressions of goodwill
on both sides.</p>

<p>I have had a deal of talk with Yang; he is
certainly by far the most advanced Chinaman I
have met yet. Railways and telegraphs, which
are the bugbears of the Chinese ministers, are
to him necessities which it is foolish to stave
off; indeed, he spoke to me about constructing
a tramway and telegraph over his property in
Shantung for the convenience of communicating
with his tenants and agents. Any new
European invention which he hears of, instead
of shaking his head and saying, “Ai ya! it is
very wonderful!” he sends for and tries to introduce
into the country. Indeed, more than this,
if he is not called to high <span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>office next year, he
proposes visiting Europe, Russia, France, and
England; perhaps he will go home with me.</p>

<p>The Peking races came off on the 4th inst.
They were a great success. The course was
made at a place called Wang-ho-lou, about
three miles outside the city. It is the bed of
an old lake dried up; a pretty spot surrounded
by hillocks, and with the mountains in the
background. Every mound was covered with
thousands of Chinese who had come to gape
and wonder at the barbarian sports. Two of
the ministers of the Foreign Office, Hêng and
Chung, came to the grand stand. Old Chung
had brought with him his grandson, a smart
little fellow of eight years old, as dignified as a
judge, and far graver than his grandfather. I
made the little fellow sit by me at breakfast,
and plied him with good things, of which he
expressed his approbation with the solemnity
of a Burleigh. Wine I could not get him to
touch, not even champagne. Altogether, considering
the means, or rather want of means,
at our disposal, we managed to have a capital
day’s sport. Our little ponies are very fast.
An old pony that Saurin gave me, “Kwan-du,”
won the half-mile race, running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span> it in one minute
and five seconds, without training, and with
11 stone on his back. Between our races the
two ministers made the officers of their escort
show off their ponies; one, a small gray pony of
Hêng’s, was a regular little beauty, and would
have been much admired in Rotten Row. But
I think that the prettiest pony on the course
was a little bay pony that I call “Hop-o’-my-thumb”—a
little fellow that I bought some time
ago to replace my cob, which, according to my
usual luck, went lame in the shoulder without
hope of cure. The Chinese on the race day
were not so civil as usual; we had much ado
to keep the course, and when we were going
away they yelled, shouted, and shrieked at us
like a pack of wolfish fiends. They even went
so far as to throw a few stones, none of which
struck any one; of course, in such a crowd it
was impossible to identify all the offenders;
however, one or two got well thrashed. A little
while ago I was riding with Sir Rutherford and
a lady to the Temple of Heaven, when at the
bottom of the main street of the Chinese city
we were mobbed and attacked with stones and
brickbats, one of which struck our escort. It is
no use complaining to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span> authorities—we get
no redress. I have begun to think for some
time past that the <i lang="fr">bonhomie</i> of the Chinese,
which was so taking to me at first, is only a
mask to cover hatred and disgust, happily
tempered by the most abject terror and
cowardice. However that may be, we are
the masters for the present, and they know
it—that is all that is required.</p>

<p>We are enjoying lovely spring weather now,
warm and genial, with a little rain to remind
one of home. The town is beginning to show
a little green from the wall, on which dog-violets
and vetches, very much dried up and sapless,
are putting their noses out of the crannies between
the bricks.</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> I last wrote I have done nothing and
seen nothing that I have not told you about over
and over again. However, to-morrow morning I
am off for a three weeks’ trip into Mongolia with
Dr. Pogojeff of the Russian Legation. We shall
go out of China by the Nan Ko̔u Pass, and come
in by my former route of Ku-Pei-Ko̔u. I am looking
forward with immense interest to seeing a
little of Mongol life for the first time. It will
be a new experience. I am afraid that one
mail must pass without taking you any news
of me; but when I return I hope to make
amends. We had a great field-day at the
Tsung-Li Yamên last week. Railroads, telegraphs,
violation of treaties, etc., all the old
stories that have been trotted out a hundred
times. The Prince of Kung was very nervous
and fidgety. He twisted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span> doubled, and dodged
like a hare. At last when Sir Rutherford had
him, as he thought, fairly in a corner, I saw a
gleam of hope and joy come over the Prince’s
face. He had caught a sight of his old friend
and refuge in trouble, my eyeglass. In a
moment he had pounced upon it, and there was
an end of all business. The whole pack of
babies were playing with it, and our Chief, who
was furious, saw his sermons scattered to the
wind. It does not signify, though, for these
tricksters will promise anything. It is the
performance which is lacking. By the bye,
when the Prince of Kung calls at a Legation
he leaves a card in the shape of a slip of red
paper with his name and title upon it—Kung
Chi̔n Wang.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> But he never signs his name to
documents; he subscribes them, Wu ssŭ hsin—“No
private heart,” <i>i.e.</i> “disinterested.”</p>

<p>A Cantonese named Ma, whom I know and
who has come up to Peking on business, was
anxious to buy a little Pekingese slave-girl, and
I was present at the negotiations. The child,
a bright little creature eight years of age, was
brought by her parents to Ma’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span> lodging, and as
she gave satisfaction, the question resolved
itself into one of price, and here the fun began,
for the little thing was so keen to go that she
eagerly took part with the purchaser in beating
down the vendors; and, finally, a bargain was
struck at 28 dollars. At that price she was
handed over to her new owner, together with a
bill of sale, of which here is a translation:—</p>

<p>“This is a deed of sale. Wan Chêng, of
the village of Wan Ping, has a child the offspring
of his body, being his second daughter
and his seventh child, aged eight years. Because
his house is poor, cold, and hungry, relying
on what has passed between a third person and
his wife, he has determined to sell his daughter
to one named Ma. He sells her for twenty-eight
dollars, every dollar to be worth seven
tiaos and a half. The money has been paid
over in full under the pen” (<i>i.e.</i> at this time of
writing). “The girl is to obey her master and
to depend upon him for her maintenance. In
the event of any difficulties or doubts arising on
the part of the girl’s family, the seller alone is
responsible, it does not regard the buyer. It
is to be apprehended that calamities may occur
to the child, but that is <span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>according as Heaven
shall decree; her master is not responsible.
None henceforward may cross the door to
meddle in her affairs. This agreement has
been made openly face to face. In case of any
inquiries being made this document is to serve
as proof.” (Here follow the signatures or
rather marks of the vendor, the middleman, and
a third person as witness, and the date.) “The
child’s birthday is the 11th day of the 6th
month, she was born between the seventh and
eighth hours.”</p>

<p>Ma declares that as soon as the girl is grown
up he shall let her marry. He says, “My no
wanchee do that black heart pidgin.” I believe
he will keep his word—it is a matter of business,
and in business the southern Chinese trader is
scrupulously honest.</p>

<p>As for the child, she was simply in a fever
of delight at leaving her parents. I dare say
her poor little life had been none too rosy; for
what says the proverb? “Better one son,
though deformed, than eighteen daughters as
wise as the apostles of Buddha.”</p>

<p>I wonder whether any European ever
witnessed such a transaction before.</p>

<p>I have been spending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span> the last few days
chiefly in Paternoster Row, the Liu Li Chang,
sitting at the feet of a very learned little Chinese
Gamaliel, who tells me wonderful stories about
the arts and the old craftsmen of China. He
is a bookseller by trade, but being a great connoisseur,
he always has a few rare specimens of
cloisonné enamel, jade, rock crystal, cornelian,
or porcelain in his shop. He is never weary
of telling how the Emperor Ching Ta̔i (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
1450) used to work at cloisonné enamel (like
Louis XVI. at locks, and Peter the Great at boat-building);
how some even say that he even
invented the art, to which the Chinese still give
his name, calling it Ching Ta̔i Lan, Ching
Ta̔i’s blue; how the great family of potters,
the Langs, died out in the beginning of the
seventeenth century, carrying their secrets with
them to the grave, and how ever since that time
the Chinese have been trying to discover their
methods—but all in vain—only producing, instead
of a wonderful <i lang="fr">sang de bœuf</i> of so soft a
paste that it looks as if you might scoop it out
with a spoon, the, as he calls them, inferior
imitations, to which the French gave the name
of Céladon Jaspé, and which the great metal
workers, such as Caffieri,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span> used to delight in
mounting. Cloisonné enamel, by the bye, went
out of fashion at the end of the last century,
and the Chinese ceased to make it; but when,
after the sacking of the Summer Palace, the
specimens looted there and sent home fetched
such wonderful prices in London and Paris,
they routed out the drawers in which their forbears
had carefully locked their recipes—for a
Chinaman never destroys anything—and soon
the market will be flooded with new work.
The first specimen was brought to me at the
Legation the other day, and very good it was.</p>

<p>The rose-backed plates and cups dear to the
keen-eyed loungers at Christie’s can never have
been the fashion at Peking, where men chiefly
love the brave colours and bold designs of the
artists of the Ming dynasty, and where purses
are opened wide for ever so small a piece of
the thickly glazed ware of the days of the Yuan
and the Sung. From Ka̔ng Hsi’s reign to the
end of Chien Lung’s, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1796, one seems to
feel the Jesuit, or European, influence in the
substitution of arabesques for the old barbaric
designs. The great age for art in China and
Japan, as in Europe, was the cinque cento; the
meanest, the dawn of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p class="right-indent">
<span class="smcap">Peking</span>, <i>23rd May 1866</i>.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I returned</span> from my Mongolian expedition last
Friday, the 18th, half-starved and burnt to a
cinder, but very jolly. I copy my journal for you.</p>

<p>We left Peking, the doctor and I, on the
23rd April. We took with us my servant
Chang Hsi, groom, and fat cook. We of course
rode our own horses, while five mules carried
the servants and baggage. The doctor’s dog
Drujok, a half-bred Russian setter, and my
Prince, a heavy shambling puppy whom I call
a Newfoundland, but whose <i lang="fr">seize quartiers</i> it
would be difficult to prove, made up the party.
Our cavalcade made a great sensation in the
streets of Peking. “Here’s a game,” shouted
the street—arabs, piggish in many respects
besides their tails; “look at the devils and the
devil dogs!” We went out at the Tê Shêng
Mên (Victory Gate).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span> So soon as we had
passed the dusty streets and suburbs obstructed
by carts and camels, whose bells and dull tramp
irritate one’s ears, while the dust they shuffle
up blinds and chokes one, the ride became
delightful. The fresh green of the budding
trees and young spring crops and the tints of
the distant hills were new life to eyes tired with
the monotonous grays of a Peking winter. It
was a lovely day too, bright, sunny, and cooled
by a fresh breeze from the mountains.</p>

<p>Former experience of carts had decided me
to take mules; but it was out of the frying-pan
into the fire. Carts are slow, mules are slower.
If one takes carts the servants are sure to stow
away one ragamuffin at least to help them with
their work and add to the expense. If one
takes mules the muleteer is sure to add a
number of mules carrying wares for trade at
the different towns, which creates endless
delays. Besides, the pack-mules cannot keep
up with the horses, and it is no joke to arrive
at an inn, tired and hungry, with the choice of
ordering a bad Chinese dinner, or waiting three
hours for the cook to come up and prepare a
better one. Being in advance, we always had
to find our own way from <span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>place to place; easy
enough if one could even get a direct answer,
but you might as well expect that from a
Reading Quaker.</p>

<p><i>Englishman</i>—“I borrow a light from your
intelligence.”</p>

<p><i>Native</i>—“Hao shwo! You are very polite.”</p>

<p><i>E.</i>—“How far is it from here to Sha-Ho?”</p>

<p><i>N.</i>—“How far is it from here to Sha-Ho?
Oh! you’re going to Sha-Ho, are you?”</p>

<p><i>E.</i>—“Yes! How far is it?”</p>

<p><i>N.</i>—“How far from here, eh? What are
you going to do at Sha-Ho?”</p>

<p><i>E.</i>—“Just going for an excursion. But
how far is it?”</p>

<p><i>N.</i>—“Just going for an excursion, eh?”</p>

<p>This sort of thing goes on until you
thoroughly lose your temper, seeing which an
old man in the crowd holds up his forefinger
and thumb in an oracular manner. This to the
initiated signifies that Sha-Ho is eight (not
two) li distant (the li is about one-third of a
mile). The Chinese have a way of counting
with their fingers, which is as necessary to
learn as the numerals of the spoken language.
They constantly answer a question of figures
by holding up one hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span> without speaking.
Up to five it is all plain sailing, but beyond
that it is not so easy. The thumb and little
finger mean <i>six</i>; thumb and two first fingers,
<i>seven</i>; thumb and forefinger, <i>eight</i>, forefinger
crooked, <i>nine</i>; second finger doubled over
forefinger, or whole hand shown, first palm
and then back, <i>ten</i>.</p>

<p>We passed our first night at Chang-ping-chou,
which was a slight roundabout, but my
companion wanted to see the Ming tombs about
which I wrote to you last autumn. We found
all the inns full, but a small beggar boy, who,
possibly with an eye to copper cash, took a
great interest in our proceedings, led us to a
neat little inn outside the walls where we were
quiet and cleanly lodged.</p>

<p class="right-indent p2">
<i>24th April.</i>
</p>

<p>We had all the trouble in life this morning
to get the mules to start. Threats of stoppages
of pay were the only means of acting on the
muleteers. Even so we only got off by eight
o’clock. The doctor and I, accompanied by my
man Chang Hsi, were to visit the tombs, while the
mules, not being supposed capable of deriving
either profit or amusement <span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>from the sight, were
to precede us to Nan-Ko̔u, and there wait our
arrival. The valley of the tombs was not so
bright and rich as when I saw it with the
autumn crops in all their luxuriance, but there
were plenty of wild-flowers, dog-violets, wild
iris, convolvulus, and others, and the persimmon
trees were a mass of bloom. The
avenue of monstrous statues appeared tame to
me in the glare of day after having seen their
weird and ghostly appearance by moonlight,
but the site and buildings must always be striking.
There are plenty of temples and palaces
in and near Peking as large and as magnificent,
but none in such good proportion; they all
look like “imitation” by the side of the
Thirteen Tombs.</p>

<p>We had to ride back to within a few hundred
yards of Chang-ping-chou before we could
reach the sandy and stony road which leads to
Nan-Ko̔u. It was burning hot, but as the
Russians say, “Heat breaks no bones,” and
with fresh, pure air to breathe it does not
much signify how hot it is. In Peking it
is another matter. We reached Nan-Ko̔u at
2 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> The little town is prettily situated at the
bottom of the famous pass <span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>to which it gives its
name. Steep cliffs enclose it on either side;
a stream of clear water—rare sight in these
parts—passes through it; and the cottages in
the valley are surrounded by trees and corn-fields.
The hills are wild and bold, with here
and there bits of wall, towers, and perhaps a
temple or shrine on the ridges. The constant
tinkling of camel and mule bells testifies to the
amount of traffic. Every other house is an
inn, and all seem bustling and prosperous.
There was plenty of movement and plenty of
noise in our inn-yard; muleteers, carters, footpads,
poultry, and asses kept up a perpetual
wrangling, crowing, and braying, while an improvisatore
in the kitchen opposite was earning
his night’s board and lodging by reciting tales
of an unedifying character for the benefit of the
host and his guests of lower degree. Although
we had arrived so early, we thought it better to
stop the night at Nan-Ko̔u and go on in the
morning, so we had time for a stroll among the
hills after dinner.</p>

<p class="right-indent p2">
<i>25th April.</i>
</p>

<p>We started at six, riding donkeys in order
to spare the ponies the rough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span> work of the pass.
The Nan-Ko̔u pass is certainly in its way very
fine. The valley, which is a gradual ascent, is
bounded on either side by steep, abrupt hills, as
barren and wild as a Scotch glen; a few trees
stud it at intervals, and a narrow thread of
water runs through it. There are plenty of
shrines about, and always perched upon cliffs
so steep that one is lost in wonder how they
ever got there. Amongst these I noticed a form
of sacred monument that was new to me, but
constantly repeated along this road—five
white-washed earthen cones like sugar-loaves, with
bats<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> or other emblems rudely painted on them;
I guess that they represent the five offerings
exposed on Buddhist altars. As an instance of
the difficulty of obtaining reliable information,
and to show how cautiously travellers’ statements
about China must be accepted, I asked
three respectable Chinese by the road what
was the meaning of these five cones. One said
that they were to keep off foxes and wolves,
another that they marked every five li along
the road, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span> third that they were
Buddhist emblems, but he did not know what they
represented. The pass itself, considering that
it is the highway between Mongolia and China,
is a very miracle of bad roads. It is as if
nature had in some stupendous convulsion burst
a passage through the mountains, leaving all
the débris in the most glorious confusion, which
man has been too idle to reduce to order.
Huge boulders of rock at every step obstruct
a way which is difficult enough already, and the
overhanging cliffs seem as if they were on the
point of throwing down more masses to block
up the road. Asses are far the best mounts
for this work. Ours carried us capitally, urged
by constant revilings from their rascally drivers.
“Egg of a turtle! what are you stopping for!”
is the mildest of their adjurations, the turtle not
being used as significative of slowness, but as
an euphemism for cuckold. There are plenty
of villages in the pass; the inhabitants do a
small trade in tea, hard-boiled eggs, and laopings
(a sort of girdle-cake), which they sell to
wayfarers. There is one very pretty little
town, Chu-Yung-Kwan, with a curious old gateway
richly carved with quaint figures and inscriptions
in Chinese, Manchu,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span> Mongolian, and
Thibetan, said to be a relic of the Yuan or
Mongol dynasty. At the top of the pass, just
before the slight descent which leads to the
plateau on the west, is an old ruined fortified
enclosure called Pa Ta Ling, “the eight great
peaks.” It is a curious place, for the inside is
literally a heap of ruins and rubbish, while the
walls and fortifications are almost perfect.</p>

<p>We breakfasted at Cha Tao at the end of
the pass, some 15 miles, and very tiring miles
too, from Nan-Ko̔u. After Cha Tao the
road lies along a sandy plain, probably once
a lake, to Hwai Lai Hsien, a pretty model of
a Chinese town, with crenelated walls and
quaint towers. East of the town is a small
river, spanned by what once has been a handsome
five-arched bridge, now of course falling
into ruin and decay. Hard by, on a low
hill, stands a temple like an Italian monastery.
We put up for the night at Hwai Lai Hsien,
having ridden some 35 miles from Nan-Ko̔u.
We had some difficulty in finding
an inn. The people of the east side of the
town sent us to the west, and the people
of the west incited us to go back to the east.
The mules and servants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span> were behind us, and
we were left entirely to our own resources.
At last my horse decided the question by
bolting down a courtyard, which turned out to
be that of the best inn in the place, but which,
it having no signboard, I had missed.</p>

<p class="right-indent p2">
<i>26th April.</i>
</p>

<p>We had a dullish ride to-day to Hsin Pao An,
passing a few small towns, all fortified, probably
against Mongol invasions; at one of these, Tu
Mu, we made our mid-day halt. Hsin Pao An
is a very pretty little town. One Chinese town
is generally so like another that if you have
seen one you have seen all. Here, however,
there is a very curious building in the middle
of the place; it is a sort of compromise between
an English town-hall, a mediæval fortress, and
a Chinese temple; it gives a distinction to the
town. It is so very rare to see a drunken man
in China that it is almost worth recording that
one rushed into our rooms here, and was proceeding
to lay hands on the doctor, who shook
him off in great astonishment, when the people
of the inn came in and turned him out, with
many apologies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span> for the annoyance.</p>

<p class="right-indent p2">
<i>27th April.</i>
</p>

<p>The main feature in the plain on leaving
Hsin Pao An is a steep mountain, or rather
precipitous and jagged rock, perhaps 800 or
1000 feet high, called Nei Nei Shan. It stands
at the western end of the plain, immediately to
the east of the Yang Ho, “sheep river,” which
winds beneath it. On the very summit of this
rock is a temple, about which there is a legend
which reminds one of Rolandseck and Nonnenwerth.
A prince of these parts had engaged
to throw a bridge over the river in a single
night, or forfeit his life. He set about his
task, but when the sun rose in the morning
the work was unfinished, so in despair and in
fulfilment of his vow he threw himself into the
river and was drowned. His widow erected
this temple that she might pass her life in
mourning in constant sight of the spot where
her husband had disappeared. I have the very
worst authority for this legend, of which, by
the bye, Bell gives another version quoted by
Michie. The Chinese about the place have
never heard of it; however, I dare say it is as
true as most other legends;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span> at any rate there
stand the hill and the temple, and there live
(heaven knows how) five priests, exposed to
the full glare of the sun, and to every cold
wind that blows, and obliged to fetch even the
water they drink up an almost inaccessible
height from the plain below. This day’s
journey, following the Yang Ho in a north-westerly
direction, was very picturesque and
varied, but often rocky to a degree. However,
our little Mongol horses behaved like
goats; they never stumble except on a flat
road, where they get careless and lazy. There
is plenty of coal in these hills, which is worked
in the meanest manner and sent to Peking on
camels. A geologist who has examined this
part of China, and especially the mountains to
the west, affirms it to be the richest coalfield
in the world, but the Chinese do not take
advantage of it. We met plenty of travellers
of all degrees, the richer ones travelling in
mule litters, a mode of conveyance which looks
to me as if it might bring on sea-sickness; and
numberless caravans laden with tea for Russia.</p>

<p>We rested at a poor little town called
Hsiang Shui Pu, and put up for the night at
Hsuan Hua Fu, a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span> district city. Here
in the suburbs we found an inn which was
a palace compared with those we had put up
in hitherto, though an English labourer’s cottage
would not suffer by contrast with the room I
slept in. A certain amount of new paper in
the windows gave a promise of cleanliness and
decency within that was not fulfilled by the
broken brick floor and musty tables and
benches; however, there were plenty of shabby,
tawdry lanterns, and if characters of good omen
could give appetite and a good night’s rest,
we ought to have eaten like ogres and slept
like the Seven Sleepers. We were a good deal
lionised here; indeed, the inquisitiveness of the
people was very troublesome. As I was lathering
my face before dinner, trying to get rid
of the deposit of two or three sandstorms,
the curse of travellers in North China, a carter
walked coolly into my bedroom smoking his
pipe, and went into fits of laughter at the sight.
I, irritated by the intrusion, flung the contents
of my soapy sponge into his face—which must
have very much astonished it, for it was much
in the same state as the fists of the Irish
boatman two years after he had shaken hands
with the Lord Lieutenant;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span> and my enemy
fled howling. Presently another gentleman
appeared who addressed me as “Venerable
Teacher”—a high compliment—and informed
me that his name was Ma, and that he was a
merchant of caps travelling from west to east;
after which he retired, but shortly put his head
in again to ask my honourable name and
nation, and I heard him afterwards in the yard
explaining to a knot of carters, muleteers, and
loungers, that I was the English teacher Mi,
that I understood good manners, that my body
was all over pockets, and that my years were
not few; which statements the auditors received
with many grunts and eructations and repeated
several times, afterwards one by one sauntering
up to judge for themselves. I happened to
be emptying my pockets at the time of Ma’s
visit. Pockets are not used by the Chinese;
they have, it is true, purses or pouches at their
girdle, but they are very small. The chief
receptacle for miscellaneous articles is the boot.
My first teacher used to pull writing materials
and sugar-plums indiscriminately from his boot,
and always politely offered me the latter before
tasting them himself. Old Hêng-Chi, the
Minister for Foreign Affairs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span> who is <i lang="fr">malade
imaginaire</i> and always dosing himself, constantly
pulls pills or other pet remedies out
of his boot. European pockets are always
provocative of wonder. The noises of the
inn-yard made sleep out of the question till
long past midnight. The worst of all was an
old carter wrapped up in his sheepskin, sitting
on the shaft of his cart and beating a sort
of death-watch with a stick on a piece of
hollow bamboo, like a ghoulish old woodpecker.
I went out and tried to chaff him out
of his performance, but he took my irony for
high praise, which so delighted him that he
every now and then burst into snatches of
song in a high squeaky falsetto, never stopping
his eternal devil’s tattoo. Mules, asses, horses,
and quarrelling Chinamen made up a fitting
chorus.</p>

<p class="right-indent p2">
<i>Saturday, 28th April.</i>
</p>

<p>Rode through the town of Hsuên Hwa
Fu, which, for China, is in tolerable repair.
Though small as “Fu’s” go, it is pretty
enough. There are plenty of trees, chiefly
huge willows and poplars, and a great variety
of quaint towers, pagodas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span> and other buildings.
The plain below is busily tilled, and, I should
think, must be fertile; but the crops are far
behind those of the Peking plain, and the first
sowings have not yet put out shoots. Here
amongst the numerous by-roads and water-courses
we lost our way, being, as usual, far
ahead of our mules. Seeing a group of boys
working a few fields off I rode across to ask
the way; their backs were turned to me, and
it was only when I jumped over a low mud
wall into the midst of them that they perceived
me. A shark appearing in Cuckoo weir while
the Eton boys are bathing, could not have
produced a greater panic. With one consent
the urchins shouted out, “The Devil! The
Devil!” and bolted for dear life. At last I
succeeded in capturing and calming one of
them, sufficiently to discover that we were
about an hour and a half’s ride out of the right
road (no joke to men fasting and under such a
sun). The deviation from the regular route
accounted for the terror caused by my appearance;
the boys had probably never seen a
foreigner before.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon we reached Chang
Chia Ko̔u, which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span> Mongols call Khalgan,
the frontier town between China and Mongolia.
It is the first great halting-place on the road
from Peking to Moscow. Formerly, when the
importation of tea into Russia by sea was forbidden,
the whole of the tea-supply passed
from Tientsing through Chang Chia Ko̔u, and
there is still a great traffic, but, of course, it is
much diminished. The Russians have no important
export trade to China. They have a
small export trade in cloth, which they manufacture,
of a kind and at a cost with which
other producers cannot compete, for their cloth
exactly suits the Chinese, being of pure wool,
very broad, and cheap; but they cannot send
it in any large quantity. At Peking, Tientsing,
and some of the large towns in North China,
there are also to be found miscellaneous articles
of Russian manufacture, such as samovars,
knives, prints, looking-glasses, etc., but, as a
rule, Siberia being a non-manufacturing country
and too short-handed to become one, goods
have to come from too far for their transport
to pay. I believe that the Russians have
found their connection with China to be, on the
whole, a losing business. They have to pay
silver—paper roubles will not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span> pass—for their tea,
and must continue to do so as long as they
cannot establish an export trade; they are
trying to obtain certain rights of trading in
Mongolia, but the Chinese cannot be persuaded
of the justice of transferring a monopoly
of their own merchants to a powerful neighbour.
In the far north they have obtained
certain harbours which open the Chinese seas
and the Pacific to them; but the harbours are
frozen for several months, and the advantage
has saddled them with huge tracts of country
which it is hard for them to rule, and still
harder for want of manual labour to turn to
profit. Russia looks to the days of railways
and telegraphs through Siberia, which are
probably not very far distant,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> to balance the
account. The truth is that the English and
Americans are the only people who have
a real commercial interest in China. The
Russian interest is at present simply one of
boundaries. With the French the Chinese
question is one of missionaries and jealousy
of the <i>interests</i> of other nations in the Far
East,—<i>interests</i> being with French alarmists
synonymous with <i>influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span></i>. The German
nations cannot as yet be said to have any great
stake here, though they have plenty of subjects
in China, principally clerks in great houses or
small merchants. Portugal has a very cleverly
worded treaty with the Chinese, who will not
ratify it because it would cede to her the
sovereignty of Macao, where she has a flourishing
trade, under the name of Chinese coolie emigration.
Spain has a treaty in an embryo state,
and conterminal interests on account of her
Philippine Islands; and Belgium has a treaty,
one resident subject, and a ship trading here
once in three years or so. The Danes have a
treaty, but little commerce. Italy two or three
years ago planned a mission hither, but it broke
down. Even should the Russians succeed in
obtaining the privileges they are working for
in Mongolia, their Chinese trade would be but
a drop in the ocean compared with our immense
commercial interests.</p>

<p class="right-indent p2">
<i>29th April.</i>
</p>

<p>In spite of the remonstrances and even tears
of our head muleteer, who predicted certain
starvation for ourselves and our mules, we
decided on pushing as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span> far as Llama Miao, the
great horse-fair in Mongolia, and returning
home <i>via</i> Ku Pei Ko̔u to vary the journey.
We accordingly resolved to stop a day at
Chang Chia Ko̔u to rest the horses and lay
in rice, flour, and other provisions, with provender
for the cattle. The delay gave us time
to see the bustling little town which trade has
redeemed from the dulness of its neighbours.
The streets are full of animation. Fortune-tellers,
improvisatori, and a company of strolling
actors who, gorgeous in stage dresses and
burlesque “makes up,” have taken possession
of a small temple, attract crowds of gaping
Mongols and Chinamen. The main street of
the suburb resembles a great fair, lined with
stalls like cheap-jack’s booths, at which every
conceivable sort of rubbish is sold. Pipes,
rings, ear-rings, sham jewelry and jade, Mongol
knives, purses, cutlery professing to be made
by Rodgers and Son, lucifer matches from
Vienna, kaleidoscopes, stereoscopes, musical
boxes and looking-glasses, with reverses quite
unfit for publication, are the chief wares.
There is a capital seven-arched bridge, adorned
with lions and apes, across the almost dry
river; and wonderful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span> to say, it is kept in
repair, so you may judge how prosperous the
place is and looks. Foreigners excite little
attention, for European travellers are often
passing; and besides, there are two or three
resident agents for Russian houses who superintend
the loading of the tea-caravans for
Siberia.</p>

<p>One thing necessary before leaving Chang
Chia Ko̔u was to get the seal of the military
authorities attached as a <i>visa</i> to my passport.
As I told you last year, the petty provincial
officers snap their fingers at the seal of the
Peking yamêns (public offices), but they respect
that of their own immediate chief, whose arm
is long enough to reach them. In the event
of meeting with any difficulty on the road I
could not count on getting any official assistance
without this seal. Accordingly, early this
morning I sent my passport to the general’s
office, with the request that it might be returned
<i lang="fr">visé</i>. At five o’clock no passport was
forthcoming, so I sent to say that I would go
in person to fetch it, and requested an interview
with his Excellency. When I arrived at
the Yamên I was told that the great man himself
was ill—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span> usual excuse—but I was
civilly received by his subordinate, a greasy
little blue-buttoned mandarin named Pao, and
two others. I repeated my request to see his
Excellency Ah (that is his name), as I knew how
futile it is to treat with subordinate Chinese
officials; but <i>his</i> Excellency only renewed his
regrets that he could not see <i>my</i> Excellency,
which he hoped was pretty well. As he might
be smoking opium and really unpresentable,
I thought it better not to press the matter
further, but attacked Pao on the subject of the
seal, which he fought off granting me on the
ground that there was nothing in the passport
saying that I was entitled to it. I answered
that the passport entitled me to expect every
aid from him, and that last year the Ti-tu of
Ku Pei Ko̔u had granted us his seal; threatened
him with the thunders of the Prince of
Kung’s wrath, and told him (Heaven forgive
me!) how angry our Queen would be if she
heard that a member of her Legation, carrying
the passport of the Legation, had been snubbed
the very first time he asked for assistance from
a Chinese official. “Would I like something
to eat?” “I was much obliged, but I was not
hungry; I wanted the seal.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span> “At least a little
jam?” “Many thanks, no jam, but the seal.”
“But the seal was really such an unimportant
matter.” “Then why not give it at once as
the Ti-tu had done.” (Which, by the bye, he
had not done without a fight.) “Oh, but the
Ti-tu lived at Ku Pei Ko̔u and this was Chang
Chia Ko̔u. How could it be done?” “Where
there’s a will there’s a way”—which is an
excellent Chinese proverb. My interlocutors
doubled at every moment like hares, now offering
tea, now dinner, now tobacco, anything but
the seal. They constantly consulted together
in Manchu, of which of course I did not understand
a word. Every now and then one went
out to report, as I imagine, to the shamming
chief what I had said. How obstinate the
barbarian was, and how suspicious, for I took
care to let them know that I was not gulled by
the very stale sick dodge. We were more
than an hour marching and countermarching
over the same ground. I stuck out for my
seal; they persisted in eluding the question.
At last I told Pao that I would either accept
the seal or a separate pass from his Excellency
Ah to his subordinates, but that if they refused
to give me one or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span> other I would write to
Peking and complain of their want of courtesy.
After some difficulty they agreed to furnish me
with a pass, and even gave orders for a draft
to be written and sent to the hotel for my
approval. I then left them, but with such
manifest disgust that they were probably afraid
that I might complain of their conduct, for
immediately I reached the inn a messenger
made his appearance, saying that Pao hoped
I was pretty well (which, considering we had
just parted, was an excess of courtesy), and had
not quite read my passport to his satisfaction;
would I let him have it back for a few minutes.
Ten minutes after this it was in my hands with
the seal attached.</p>

<p>In the meantime our lachrymose muleteers
had made off to Peking with their mules,
abandoning their pack-saddles and ropes, and
forfeiting all their earnings, save an advance
which I had made them, rather than face the
imaginary horrors of the road to Llama Miao.
Here was a pretty kettle of fish! All hopes
of an early start completely bowled out; and
really Chang Chia Ko̔u is a very nice place, but
one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span> day is enough of it.</p>

<p class="right-indent p2">
<i>30th April.</i>
</p>

<p>The whole of this morning was wasted in
fruitless endeavours to get mules or carts. The
carters and muleteers, knowing our anxiety to
be off, demanded fabulous prices, and absolutely
declined to start until to-morrow; we were as
determined to make a move to-day. At last,
in despair, the doctor rode off to the Russian
agents to see whether they could not do something
to help us. It is no use applying to the
authorities, for their practice in such cases is to
be extremely civil and obliging, at once procure
the worst and cheapest beasts in the place,
arrange for a high price, and pocket the difference;
and then when the traveller is a hundred
miles or so away from all help a horse or mule
dies of a ripe old age, and the others are so
feeble and decrepit that he does not reach his
destination until his stock of provisions has
long been exhausted, and himself has had to
suffer days of needless privation and discomfort.
During the doctor’s absence Chang
Hsi, who had gone out as plenipotentiary in
another direction, came back with a treaty for
ratification between himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span> under the style of
“Chang the great Lord,” and a hirer of carts,
who was willing to convey our baggage to
Llama Miao for rather more than double the
proper fare. The doctor’s negotiations were
more successful, for he returned with a wild-looking
ruffian, with whom we finally made
almost satisfactory arrangements, though neither
promising, coaxing, nor threatening would induce
him to start until the next day.</p>

<p class="right-indent p2">
<i>1st May.</i>
</p>

<p>A short time since a missionary presented
me with a copy of the <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>
translated into Chinese, and adorned with
pictures, in which Christian and the other
characters appear with long tails <i lang="fr">à la Chinoise</i>.
If any one will produce a similar edition of <i>Don
Quixote</i> for the benefit of the mandarins, I shall
recommend our carter as model for the portrait
of the knight. His prominent nose, lantern
jaws, and tall, thin, ungainly figure exactly fit
the character; it is a type I never before saw
in China. Any one of his horses would make
a capital Rosinante. We made a late start of
it, not getting off until eight o’clock, and even
then our people lagged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span> behind in the town to
buy things. At the gate of the town, where
the Great Wall of China is the frontier mark,
we met with no difficulties, our passports were
not examined, and the officials only took down
our names and the number of our party. The
day’s march was dull and monotonous; it lay
along a continuously ascending pass, winding
between barren hills, which bounded the view.
We met strings of camels, mules, and bullock-carts,
all laden with tea for Russia and Mongolia.
The tea that is imported by the Mongols
is of the coarsest quality, and pressed into large
bricks, which look something like cavendish
tobacco, only coarser, and with stronger fibres
to bind them together. These bricks are in
some parts the current coin of the country:
large transactions are settled for so many bricks
of tea, while smaller payments are made by
cutting pieces off the block as the Chinese cut
fragments of silver. The infusion made from
brick tea is coarse and nasty; it often has a
musty taste owing to the damp confined in the
cakes, which prevents their transport by sea.</p>

<p>We breakfasted at Tu-ting, a miserable little
village of mud hovels which at a little distance
look like mere holes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span> in the hill; the place
reminded me of a colony of fever-stricken Circassians
whom I saw during their exodus two
years ago, burrowing like rabbits in a bank near
Tchernavoda. Barring the fever there was
not much choice in appearance between the
two. After Tu-ting the ascent becomes so
steep that horses are kept by the wayside, as
on the St. Gothard, to draw up heavy carts to
a ledge on which stands a temple in honour of
Kwan Ti, the god of war, whither pious carters
repair to deposit an offering on having successfully
made the ascent. Pa Ta, where we passed
the night at the sign of the “Ten Thousand Perfections,”
was hardly richer than Tu-ting. Our
beds were made in the kitchen amid flour-bins,
jars of oil, pots of stinking cheese, and odds
and ends of all sorts. It was the best room of
the inn, which was a low hut built of mud and
chopped straw, roofed over, but with the bare
ground for a floor. This is not comfort, but
<i lang="fr">à la guerre comme à la guerre</i>.</p>

<p class="right-indent p2">
<i>2nd May.</i>
</p>

<p>A couple of hours more uphill and we were
fairly on the Mongolian plateau. A branch of
the Great Wall runs <span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>along the mountains; but
here it is a mere heap of stones thrown together,
a wonderful work of patience, it is true, but
lacking the grandeur of the brick-built wall at
Ku Pei Ko̔u; at intervals are rude turrets
fallen or falling into utter decay.</p>

<p>The plateau itself is a vast sea of downs
bounded only by the horizon. It is difficult to
conceive anything more desolate; there is
neither tree nor shrub, nothing taller than a
few dwarfish buttercups and campanulas; there
is not so much as a stone to sit down upon; for
miles and miles there is no trace of human
habitation or handiwork; for miles and miles
one travels without meeting a soul, except by
chance a stray Mongol lumbering heavily along
on his camel, or a bullock-cart carrying tea; of
beasts we saw a flock of Hwang-yang antelopes,
that scampered off almost before there was time
to recognise them; the dogs started a fox; a
raven was feeding on a dead dog, and a solitary
vulture followed in our wake for hours, as if he
expected one or other of us to come to grief,
but for to-day he was disappointed. We rested
at Shi Pa Li Tai, having made an absurdly short
day’s journey, but it was impossible to stir our
Don Quixote into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span> anything like activity.</p>

<p class="right-indent p2">
<i>3rd May.</i>
</p>

<p>We rose long before sunrise, intending to
make up for lost time. The early morning on
the steppes is something beautiful. Flocks of
larks, mocking and other birds are singing
away as if their throats must burst, the air is
as keen and fresh as possible, and there is just
a sparkling of dew on the ground. On such a
morning and on such ground our little horses,
in spite of the journey before them—of which
they always seem to have a sort of instinctive
knowledge, for when the holsters and headstalls
are put on, the very worst of them sober
down and behave well—cannot resist a gallop.
They lift their heads, and turning towards the
breeze sniff it in by long draughts with a zest
that it is good to see, and spin away like mad
things over the steppe on which they were born
and reared. The dogs catch the infection, and
are in the most tearing spirits, careering away
far out of sight; Drujok, whose sporting education
has been sadly neglected, setting a bad
example in a wild lark chase, which my puppy
Prince is not slow to follow. Roads across the
plateau there are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span> none; and we soon raced
away from all sign of the (at best) puzzling
tracks of rare carts and horses. Here was a
pretty mess! Lost on the steppe like sailors
at sea in a cock-boat without a compass! not a
landmark of any sort; a boundless plain with a
round horizon! After some while spent in
fruitless consultation, to our joy a speck began
to rise on the horizon; bigger and bigger it
grew, until at last it defined itself into the
figure of a very jolly, fat, yellow-robed priest,—a
sort of Mongol Friar Tuck riding on his
camel,—who could fortunately speak a little
Chinese. The good-natured fellow, shaking his
sides with laughter at our mischance, put his
helm about and rode a mile or two out of his
own way to steer us into ours, so that in the
end we found ourselves at Pan Shan Tu a
couple of hours before our people. As we had
started at three in the morning on the strength
of a cup of tea and a couple of eggs, and had
been eight hours in the saddle, it was rather
trying to wait until past one o’clock for a
meal. Still more trying was it as the evening
closed in, and the gathering clouds warned us
that there would be no moonlight to guide us,
to find ourselves 25 miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span> from our destination,
in the middle of the wilderness, and the cart-horses
hardly up to 3 miles an hour. Happily
we came upon a group of Mongol yurts (huts
or tents), and their uncouth owners were willing
and able to take us in. Indeed, as I found out
afterwards, the huts on this track are almost
available as inns for travellers. We were, as
usual, in advance of our party and unable to
speak a word of Mongol; however, from the
yurts there appeared a wild, gaunt figure, which
from its wearing ear-rings and long hair, and
from no other sign, I knew to be a woman; in
the kindliest but roughest manner she seized
the horses and led them to a post, to which she
tied them, and then opening one of the yurts,
beckoned us to go in and warm ourselves, for
it was very chilly. In this hut were crowded
a few men, women, and naked children, a calf
and several lambs, all huddling together round
the fire: what an etching Rembrandt would
have made of it! The air was stifling; between
smoke and strong smells it was almost impossible
to breathe; however, the good lady cleared
out another hut, which by the time our servants
came up was ready for us.</p>

<p>A Mongol yurt is of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span> simplest construction.
A round, raised floor, from twelve to
fifteen feet in diameter, is made of mud and
chopped straw; round this is built a wall of
trellis-work of laths about four feet high, from
which a number of sticks radiate to a point at
the top; a thick covering of pieces of felt tied
on with strong cord completes the hut; even
the trellis-work is fastened by thongs of leather
passed through holes made at the point where
the laths cross one another. The whole can
easily be taken to pieces and packed on a
camel’s back. The furniture of the interior is
not more luxurious than the exterior: in the
centre is an iron fireplace, in which is burnt a
fire of horse- or cow-dung, which is the only
fuel to be procured, and is collected with great
pains on the plateau; the smoke, so much at
least as does escape, finds its way through a
hole in the middle of the roof; four iron bars
support over the fire the single pan in which all
the cooking of the family is done; round the
tent are a few chests and presses of the rudest
Chinese manufacture, and the homeliest of brass
pots and pans from Peking; a few sheep-skins
and calf-skins and pieces of felt represent bed,
sofa, and chair; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>the whole is blackened by
much smoke like a cutty-pipe. A flap of felt
serves as door; the hole in the roof is chimney
and window in one, and if it rains that must be
covered in. Perhaps the quaintest thing about
the place, and the strongest sign of the poverty
of the land, was the kitchen garden inside the
yurt. A basket or pan and a broken teacup,
into which a little mould had been placed, were
beds in which half a dozen carefully-tended heads
of garlic were sprouting! There were no stables;
the Mongols do not use them. When they
want a horse they go and catch one out of the
herd. Our horses were tied up to stakes outside.
The cattle keep near the camp of their
own accord; the sheep are packed under a
shed, so they enjoy a covering; but the young
things—calves, lambs, and kids—are carried
into the yurts and sleep with the other children.
Such was our lodging for the night, and, tired
as we were, it did well enough for us. Our
dinner was a more difficult matter; our cook
did his best for us, but he was sorely put to it
for saucepans and other requisites. As I said
above, the pan or caldron over the dung-fire
is the whole Mongol <i lang="fr">batterie de cuisine</i>. Into
it is thrown a quantity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span> of millet or other grain
and a few lumps of fat mutton or beef, which is
stewed in water. When the solid part of this
has been taken out, the greasy water which
remains serves to make the infusion of brick
tea. Even the lowest Chinese cannot stomach
this nasty mess, and speak of it with the
greatest disgust. In some parts of Mongolia
an infusion of brick tea is made with boiling
milk and salt, and always kept ready in the
yurt. This is said to be very good. I had
been looking forward to getting a drink of fresh
milk, but the Mongols all say that their cows
have died. Calves a few days old, and in very
good condition, tell another story.</p>

<p>When we had established ourselves in the
yurt, the head of the encampment, introduced
by the Meg Merrilies who had taken us in and
done for us, and whom I imagine to have been
his wife, came to visit us. He spoke a little
Chinese, which is necessary to him when he
goes to Chang Chia Ko̔u to sell his cattle. He
told us he was a military officer, but without
soldiers to command. Of the world beyond
Chang Chia Ko̔u on one side and Llama Miao
on the other he knew nothing. His flocks and
his tents were his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span> whole life. The women,
young and old, had no objection to showing
themselves; they came to look at us, and
brought their children, whom we made happy
with cakes and white sugar. Round-faced,
flat-featured, healthy, dirty, and ugly are the
women; as for the men, sun, wind, and weather
have burnt and hardened them to a degree in
comparison with which the most weather-beaten
old sea-dog at Portsmouth or Plymouth is satin-skinned.
Men and women alike are dressed
in long sheep-skin robes, with the wool worn
inwards, and round fur caps. Their shapeless
dresses and round head-pieces remind one of
the family in the Noah’s arks. The people
appear very jolly and simple, which they are,
and very honest, which report says they are
not. Small articles to which they may take a
fancy are said to disappear mysteriously. The
Mongolian dogs, several of whom guard each
encampment, to the great discomfiture of
Drujok and Prince, who, on the prowl after
water, are constantly attacked by them, are fine
beasts—huge, shaggy fellows, mostly black-and-tan,
with glorious tails curling over their
backs; they must be awkward customers. In
spite of the squalor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span> in which our hosts live,
they are rich people in their way, and well-to-do;
dirt and wretchedness must be with them
a matter of choice, not necessity, for their thriving
flocks find a ready market at Chang Chia Ko̔u
for the supply of Peking. Things which are
of the most ordinary necessity to the poorest
Chinaman these comparatively prosperous people
do without. They have not even a teapot or teacup;
and when we suggested washing our faces
a rusty old iron basin was dragged out of some
corner where it must have lain unused and
forgotten for months.</p>

<p>It blew a gale of wind in the night, and rain
came on, so we were able to test the comfort of
the tent. We suffered neither from cold nor
rain; in fact, nothing could be better adapted
than these huts for the extreme weather of the
steppe. If it is fine you can sleep with the sky
above you. If it is cold the felt is a sufficient
protection. It was bitterly chilly outside, but
within, although we could not bear a fire on
account of the smoke, we were as warm as
toasts.</p>

<p class="right-indent p2">
<i>4th May.</i>
</p>

<p>A pelting wet morning. We took leave of
our friends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span> the Mongols, and rode to
Chang-ma-tsze-chin, a Chinese colony, some twenty
miles off, it being too bad weather to push
farther. We made friends with the whole
village through its children. A pedlar happened
to be passing that way, and by investing a few
pence in small looking-glasses and such toys, we
made the little boys and girls very happy. To
these the pedlar’s pack of rubbish contained all
the wonders of Aladdin’s palace, for had he not
come all the way from Peking? Our door at
the inn was thronged with jolly little urchins for
the rest of the day, and we amused ourselves
and them by showing them our watches, pencil-cases,
etc. The plains or valleys here are
narrower and surrounded by hills. I climbed
one height, from which I had a fine view over
the steppe.</p>

<p class="right-indent p2">
<i>5th May.</i>
</p>

<p>The beauty of the morning made up for
yesterday. We were up by 3 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> The
vapours of the night before had settled down in
dew on the ground, the sun was rising brilliantly
among fleecy clouds, which continued all day to
throw over the hills lights and shades such as
one sees in Europe—never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span> at Peking, where
the sky must either be black with storm, or deep
blue without a speck upon it. We stopped to
breakfast at a Mongol encampment, on the near
side of an immense plain. I never saw so many
horses at one time in my life—the plateau was
literally alive with them; they were very shaggy
in their winter coats, and did not show to
advantage on the poor commons they had had
to put up with during the winter; but some of
them were well built for strength and endurance,
with deep chests, strong quarters, and big
barrels. We were received in the yurt of a
widow, named Apakwai, a most ill-favoured
dame; however, her tent was the best in the
place, and the cleanest, which is not high praise.
She was rich in furniture, skins, and felt mats,
and there was even some little attempt at
decoration about her habitation, a few Chinese
prints of the rudest kind and most defiant of
perspective being pasted on the trellis walls;
they were coloured in the garish style so
pleasing to Mongols, who are far more Oriental
in this respect than the sober Chinese. A
Mongol swell, riding over the plain, gorgeous
in yellow and vermilion, and with his jolly moon
face beaming out of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>a yellow cap, red-buttoned
and trimmed with sables, is a sight to see. The
ladies are great customers with the Peking
jewellers for coral, pearls, and jade ornaments.
A woman, be she never so poor, is sure to have
some piece of finery in the way of ear-rings or
head-dress from Peking. If she cannot afford
real jewellery she buys sham.</p>

<p>The widow Apakwai could speak no Chinese,
but as every one about the camp came in to
idle away an hour, we had no lack of interpreters.
The chief personage spoke Chinese
fluently. Apakwai lost her husband in the war
of 1860, where the Mongols were always sent
to the front to be shot at, and really, with such
a wife, he was lucky to get out of the world.
She had a most villainous expression of countenance,
only exceeded in ugliness by her familiar
spirit, a little dog of preternatural hideousness,
with a hunch on his back and a revolting
human face. I tried to conciliate him with
“po-po,” Chinese cakes, which he accepted with
avidity, and even condescended to sit up and
beg for like a Christian dog, but so soon as
my store was exhausted he snapped at me as
spitefully as ever. The old lady had other
familiar spirits even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span> more disgusting, of whose
presence she gave evidence by much unbuttoning
of robes and scratching. The widow was
very eager for cigars and white sugar, which
we could not spare her, and as she sat smoking
her pipe and grumbling over the money our
servants had paid her for the use of her yurt,
she was the picture of greed and avarice.
I added to her gains, but even that did not
satisfy her. Altogether, if I had a pound
of cigars, a loaf of sugar, and a purseful of
money, I should be sorry to sleep alone in
her yurt. I should dream of Jael and Sisera
all night.</p>

<p>At about two or three miles, at a guess,
N.W. of the camp stands a large temple, Ma
Shên Miao, the temple of the horse spirit,
most appropriately placed and dedicated; with
my field-glass I could see large trees, leafless
as yet, in its enclosure, the only trees that we
have seen since Chang Chia Ko̔u. Their size
shows that the temple is old, for of course they
must have been planted there by the monks. Between
the camp and Shang-tu-ho, where we slept,
the plain was boundless in length, and confined
at the sides by picturesque heights coloured by
every variety of light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span> and shade. The distance
gave us the most perfectly deceptive mirage I
ever saw. It was exactly like a vast lake, the
hill spurs running out into it like promontories,
and forming bays and creeks. Near Shang-tu-ho
we passed by the roadside four stakes driven
into the ground, to each of which was attached
a cage containing the head of a man in a
frightful state of decomposition. The tail of
one had escaped from between the bars of the
cage, and was dangling to and fro mournfully
in the wind. They were the heads of four
Chinese highwaymen, once the terror of the
road; now, poor wretches, they can only frighten
the horses, who may well shy at so ugly a sight.
We saw large flocks of Hwang-yang antelopes,
but they disappear like white clouds into space,
and there is no chance of getting a shot at
them.</p>

<p class="right-indent p2">
<i>6th May.</i>

<p>By way of a change, and to spare my old
pony Kwandu, whose turn it was for duty, I
walked the first stage, some sixteen miles or
more, to Ta Liang Ti. Two miles to the west
of the road we passed the Wang-ta-jên-Miao,
the temple of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span> his Excellency Wang, the
burial-place of a Mongol chieftain of that name,
where, as the carter told me, reside the officers
in charge of an Imperial establishment for breeding
horses. A little excitement was added to
the second half of the day by our being warned
of a band of “chi-ma-tseih,” horse brigands,
who infest the neighbourhood. The Mongols
of a large encampment near Ta Liang Ti have
been waging war against them; yesterday they
caught four, the day before eight, all of whom
will be sent to Chang Chia Ko̔u for trial. The
heads we saw yesterday belonged to four of
their troop. The ground is admirably adapted
for their operations. The track skirts a number
of low hills, among which they hide, pouncing
out upon travellers who are too weak in numbers
to offer resistance. The people about are really
panic-stricken, and no single cart ventures on
the road. An additional cause of fear is that
these brigands are Shantung men, who have
the reputation of being very terrible. The
deuce a tail of a robber did we see, but we
met a Mongol armed to the teeth and carrying
his long pole and rope for horse-catching—a
most powerful engine against a mounted
robber—who asked me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span> in what the Mrs. Malaprop
of Peking used to call “broken china,”
whether I had seen any brigands, saying that
he was one of a party out on the war-trail
after them. I could only wish him “good luck
with his fishing.” We slept at Ha Pa Chiao,
where, as at Ta Liang Ti, the people were
especially civil.</p>

<p class="right-indent p2">
<i>7th May.</i>
</p>

<p>To-day we “received bitters unsurpassable,”
as the Chinese say when they come to grief—thirty-five
miles’ ride at a foot-pace, for we
could not leave the baggage in a storm of wind,
rain, thunder and lightning, which regularly
pursued us. The sandy soil was so heavy that
the cart-wheels could hardly turn; the horses
were quite exhausted. About two miles from
Llama Miao, where the storm had lashed itself
to its greatest fury, we came to a small plateau
surrounded by low hills. Here we witnessed
a phenomenon, new to me, and which I certainly
never wish to see again. The thunder,
which seemed to circle round the hills, roared
savagely and cracked with deafening peals,
while the lightning ran along the ground criss-crossing
in every direction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span> until the little plain
was covered with a perfect network of blue
liquid flames, from the meshes of which escape
seemed impossible. The effect on the horses
was indeed electric. Mine stood still and
shivered with fear, breaking out into a white
lather of sweat, while the doctor’s, with a
scream, bolted madly into space, fortunately
taking the direction of the town. It was a
weird scene, befitting a witch’s Sabbath. A
thunderstorm in Mongolia is indeed a trial to
one’s nerves. To put the finishing touch to our
misery, when we arrived at Llama Miao drenched,
cold, and hungry, inn after inn refused to take
us in, and we were for near an hour riding
through the wet streets, the people howling at
us, and a whole pack of curs yelping and snapping
at our dogs. At last we found an asylum
in a large but wretched inn; the last tenants of
the rooms we occupied had been horses, and
my bedroom was also used as a cart-house.
We were a good deal mobbed; a foreigner
here is a <i lang="la">rara avis</i>, and we created no small
sensation, every dirty ragamuffin in the place
crowding into the yard. What excites the
greatest astonishment is that we are travelling
for no business. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>To leave all one’s comforts
and ride four hundred miles for pleasure beats
their comprehension, and the Chinese are convinced
that the barbarian has a bee in his
bonnet.</p>

<p>Llama Miao is a large Chinese colony in the
midst of a sandy desert, four or five thousand
feet above the level of the sea. The Mongols
call it Talonoru, which the Russians have
softened into Dolonor. The Chinese name,
which means “llama’s temple,” is taken from
two huge monasteries of llamas, “the old
temple” and “the new temple,” which stand
by the side of a small stream outside the town.
They are rather villages than temples, however,
and contain, as the landlord and other natives
told me, several thousand llamas. We were
unable to go into them, for the river, swollen
by the rain, was impassable; but we did not
much regret this, for all the temples have a
strong family likeness, and we have both had
our fill of big Buddhas and dirty shaven monks
with idiotic faces (the llamas are by far the
lowest type in China), out of whom there is
not even any information<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span> about their fraternity
to be got, for if you ask them some question
touching their order, it is ten to one that they
will reply by another about your clothes. We
contented ourselves with a distant view of the
Miao. In size, but in nothing else, they
reminded me of the Troitzkaia Lavra near
Moscow, which is also quite a small city.</p>

<p>The Mongols flock to Llama Miao to sell
their horses, cattle, wool, and raw hides to
the Chinese, who, in return, supply them with
corn of all kinds, and such simple manufactured
necessaries as the Mongols require for their
camps, at between three and four times Peking
prices. A measure of corn, which costs 100
cash in Peking, costs 3½ times that amount
here. This trade, for the landlord says there
is no other, has been sufficiently attractive to
convert Llama Miao into a town, 6 li (2 miles)
long by 4 li (1⅓ mile) broad, and densely
peopled. We passed a dreary day, shivering
in our fur coats. We saw no good horses for
sale, but one fine little gray pony, private
property, was brought to a farrier’s opposite,
and bled in the street. I have since heard
that there is a great business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span> done in bronze
idols.</p>

<p class="right-indent p2">
<i>9th May.</i>
</p>

<p>We had a better chance of seeing the town
and horse-fair as we rode through to-day.
Yesterday the rain had made business dull,
but to-day there were hundreds of little horses
for sale; their owners were leading them about,
strung together in packs, or galloping them
madly about, to show off their paces, to the
great danger of the mob, and especially of the
small boys, who were scattered from under one
horse’s feet to another’s, but always escaped by
a miracle. The show was bad in quality, for
the best horses are not brought in until the
summer or autumn. Our horses, from their
superior grooming and feeding, were much admired,
but our saddlery received an ovation.
“Ai ya!” said an old Chinese horse-dealer,
passing a dirty thumb over my saddle, “a man
may grow old in these parts over the border,
and never see such a saddle as that! Unsurpassable!”
Besides the horsey gentlemen,
there is a large population of craftsmen, such
as ropemakers, basketmakers, shoemakers, and
the like. With the exception of a few large
well-built places of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span> business, which have even
some pretension to ornamental architecture, the
houses are small and poor. Altogether, Llama
Miao is not a place worth a visit on its own
account; we merely took it as a good point to
reach and turn back from. If it had not been
for the fact that we were riding back to Peking,
I should not have been sorry to leave it.</p>

<p>We stopped at a small roadside inn for
breakfast. The people were such a contrast
to the town-folk, who are always impertinent
and obstructive. The villagers are simple creatures,
and so civil and obliging. Sitting on a
bench outside the inn was a very small boy,
dirty to a degree, but excessively pretty, feeding
his younger brother of three years old with a sort
of macaroni, which he was stuffing down his
throat with chop-sticks; the father, a good-humoured
countryman, was sitting hard by, resting
and smoking his pipe. I gave the little
fellow a sixpence, which he so sweetly made
over to the younger child. As I sat chatting
with these people up rode a well-dressed
Chinese, followed by his servant also on horseback.
He stopped, called for a cup of tea,
drank it, and went off without paying. I saw
that my friends <span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>loved him as a mouse does a
cat, and asked who he was. He turned out to
be a customs officer. “A terrible fellow,” said
one; “if travellers don’t bribe him, he stops
them, and takes their luggage, swearing that
they are smuggling.” The respect which the
Chinese have for their rulers is truly touching.
Our charioteer made me promise to-day to give
him a pass from the Legation when we reach
Peking, without which, and perhaps in spite
of which, he, being a countryman, would be
mulcted at the gate on his return home.</p>

<p>About twenty miles from Llama Miao, at a
place called Shui-Hsien-Tszŭ, the sandy plain
ends, and the character of the scenery changes
completely.</p>

<p>The road winds down a steep ravine between
hills and rocks of every variety of shape; a tiny
torrent follows the same line. There are a few
trees, leafless as yet, and here and there the
lower hills are tilled. Cottages are plentiful,
and the number of travellers shows that we are
on the high-road to Peking. We passed the
night at Kou Mên Tzŭ. The people were as
civil as possible, but very inquisitive, examining
all our belongings with childish curiosity.
They were above all delighted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span> with my field-glass,
through which they begged to be allowed
to look. They took the greatest care of it, and
if any one was too eager the others shouted,
“Don’t snatch, don’t snatch.” It was given
back to me by the elder of the party, who said
with the greatest gravity, “Venerable teacher,
you have opened our eyes,” and then proceeded
to lecture upon us for the benefit of a party of
new-comers. “What are you come to sell?”
said one, interrupting the lecture. “Sell
things!” shouted my exhibitor indignantly;
“what thing are you? He don’t sell things;
he’s an officer like our chih hsien!”—which
office is promotion for a brass-buttoned mandarin
of a rank about equal to a parish beadle. Popular
enthusiasm reached its height when I pulled out
an old number of the <i>Saturday Review</i> and began
to read. I can now realise the feelings of a giant
in a caravan, travelling from place to place and
being shown wherever he goes.</p>

<p class="right-indent p2">
<i>10th May.</i>
</p>

<p>Below Kou Mên Tzŭ runs a mountain stream,
over which there is a rude bridge supported on
fascines filled with rubbish and loose stones.
The village, from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span> left bank of the river,
looks very picturesque, and there is a temple
on the hillside that is a little gem in its way.
After ascending the river for some little distance
we dived into another mountain gorge, more
beautiful and wild than that of yesterday. The
rocks are bolder and more striking, and the hillsides
are covered with a dwarf wild fruit tree
bearing a pink flower as brilliant as the wild
rhododendron of the Alps. There are a few
tender shoots, too, on the stunted trees and
shrubs, which, with the mosses and lichens
covering the different strata of rocks, add colour
to the landscape. As the road is a perpetual
zigzag one is constantly coming upon fresh
surprises and new forms. To-day’s ride would
have been perfect had it not been for a storm
of wind and sand which destroyed our pleasure.
We rested at Hung Tu̔ng Tien, and our abode
for the night was at Lao Wo Pu̔, a quiet little
place, where the inn, which stands at a turn of
the road, is perfectly circled by hills, as if it
were in a devil’s punch-bowl. As we sat in
the pretty inn-yard we agreed that in spite of
bad weather and cold (we had found ice in
several places) we had seldom enjoyed a day
more. One advantage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span> gained over our previous
days was that by loitering on the way and
stopping to “sit a sit and rest a rest” in different
cottages, where we were always made welcome,
we managed to arrive at the inn after our
servants instead of before. It is such a bore
having to look after the cleaning of the rooms
and the stabling of the horses in the midst of a
gaping crowd of wonderers.</p>

<p class="right-indent p2">
<i>11th May.</i>
</p>

<p>Descending the pass the valley widens; the
mountain streamlet becomes quite a river,
which we have to cross over and over again; it
is very rapid, and at the fords the water reaches
to the horses’ girths. The ground here is
carefully tilled, and well irrigated as it is, must
be fertile. I saw a jolly old couple cultivating
their little field together: the old man was
painfully working out furrows with a hoe, while
his wife, stumping along on her small feet,
sowed the seed out of a wooden vessel, with a
spout like a watering-pot, which she tapped
with a stick to let the grain fall out by degrees.
I hope they may have a good harvest. Our
two resting-places were Kwa Ti Erh and Kwo
Chia Tu̔n, a large <span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>village with particularly
disagreeable inhabitants, whose practice it is to eat
much garlic and then breathe in the face of
travellers. The sand-storm this afternoon was
one of the worst I have seen. It blinded us
and threw a yellow pea-soup fog over scenery
that is as beautiful as mountains and river can
make it.</p>

<p class="right-indent p2">
<i>12th May.</i>
</p>

<p>We were warned last night to be on our
guard and look out for brigands, but nothing
came of it. This morning we turned off into
another pass steering south-west. Here we
had a change in the landscape, for the hills
were covered with trees and brushwood, showing
more green as we got farther south. The
people cried wolf again about robbers, but they
do not seem to fancy attacking Europeans; the
bore of it is that we are bound to do escort duty
and stick to the cart, which would not be safe
without us and our revolvers. The Chinese are
in mortal terror of them, so a bumbailiff from
the Chih-hsien’s yamên at Fêng Ming Hsien
begged us to let him travel with us for company
and protection. He had been all the way to Kou
Mên Tzŭ on foot to claim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span> a debt of six taels
(£2). He told me he was between fifty and
sixty years old, and had been a confirmed opium-smoker
for twenty years and more, smoking
regularly twice a day, once after each meal.
He was as hale and hearty as need be,
walking his thirty miles a day with a heavy
pack on his back, for, with an eye to the
main chance, he was going to combine with
his official business a little peddling trade on
his own account—a fresh proof that opium
if not taken in large quantities is not so
enervating after all. As for its effect on the
mind, some of the cleverest Chinese are
habitual smokers. I must say that I have
never seen anything which bears the faintest
resemblance to the horrors of opium-smoking
described in books. This man told me that
opium still gave him delicious dreams, but said
he regretfully, “It’s all folly, they never come
true.” Our first fifteen miles lay along very
broken ground—terrible work for the horses—but
so picturesque, that if any brigands had
appeared I should have expected them to come
out decked in ribands and tall hats like Mr.
Tupman. A common crowd of Chinese ragamuffins
would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span> been sadly out of tune.
One descent that we had to make was so
abrupt that I fully expected our heavy baggage-cart
to come down with a run; however, the
carter showed his ingenuity, and improvised a
drag with a huge log of wood which he lashed
behind the cart, fastening it to the axletree with
a tourniquet; this made an effective but not very
lasting break; as the wheels wore through the
wood he tightened the tourniquet, and so
brought the cart safe to the bottom. From the
top of the pass we had a magnificent panorama
of mountains, range rising above range, north
and south, in huge fantastic masses, with dark
foreground and melting blue distances. Beneath
us to the south lay a little hill-girt valley
green with young wheat and trees almost in full
leaf, a little Eden in the wilderness. At the
farther end of this valley is a pretty hamlet
called Niu Chuên Tzŭ, where we breakfasted in
a clean, tidy inn. We had now travelled over a
hundred miles through narrow mountain passes,
but soon after we had left Niu Chuên Tzŭ our
road opened out into a valley so broad as to be
almost a plain. The sun was setting and
lighting up the mountains that separated us
from China as we rode<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span> into Fêng Ming Hsien,
a pleasant town to look at, but to us very inhospitable;
the best inns rejected us, and we
were so mobbed and persecuted after we had
found a resting-place, that I was obliged to
appeal to the executive to get the inn-yard
cleared. The executive made its appearance in
the shape of a large and very dirty gentleman
with an unkept tail, who by dint of a deal of
threatening and bad language procured for us
peace and quiet.</p>

<p class="right-indent p2">
<i>13th May.</i>
</p>

<p>Of course, because our inn was particularly
dirty and bad, the innkeeper was proportionately
extortionate. He was evidently a bad
character and rather fallen in the world, and
had taken us in, in spite of prejudices which he
shared with the rest of his fellow-townsmen, in
order to make a profit out of us. We were
glad to be quit of him, the inn, and the town.
Our mid-day halt was at a very different sort
of place, a little village called Shou Hu Ying,
which takes its name from a tradition that the
famous Emperor, Káng Hsi, once came here
a-hunting, and killed a tiger on the spot where
the village now stands.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span> There was only one
inn, humble enough, but very clean, and a few
pots of flowers in the principal room gave it
an air of smartness. The guest-room also
served as village school, of which all the paraphernalia
were scattered about. There was
the magisterial chair and scholars’ stools covered
with bits of felt or sheep-skin,—more luxury
than we had at Eton,—well-thumbed copies of
the San-tzŭ-ching,—three character classic,—the
Chinese boy’s primer, a few cheap writing-materials,
and a copy-book in which some little
urchin had been making laborious attempts at
copying the numerals and other simple characters.
By way of ornament there was a picture
of four little boys representing the seasons,
dancing round a basket of impossible flowers
with the most grotesque contortions, with the
superscription, “The four seasons when prosperous
beget riches.” In the cause of letters
it was satisfactory to know that we were not
interrupting studies, for the dominie had given
himself and the boys a holiday, and had betaken
himself to a fair at the neighbouring village of
Po Li Nao, in order to go to the theatre. It
is very funny to hear a class of little fellows
droning out the classics,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span> of which they don’t
understand a word, in chorus, the tones of the
language making a sort of cadence. The
system of teaching a boy a lot of characters
without their sense, each character simply representing
a meaningless sound to him, could
only exist in China. We passed Po Li Nao,
some fifteen li farther on, and to the great
astonishment of the sightseers did not stop to
hear a play by a troupe of poor strollers. “What!
been to Po Li Nao and didn’t go to see the
theatre! Ai ya! that’s strange!” said a footpad
of whom I asked the way. At any rate we
saw what was better, Po Li Nao itself, one of
the most picturesquely situated little places I
have seen in China. It stands at the foot of a
bend of low hills, above which rises a towering
range of dark, jagged peaks, and beside it winds
a clear pebbly stream, breaking here and there
against large stones; add to this a few quaint
Chinese buildings, plenty of trees, and all the
bustle of the fair. We had a difficult sandy
track again for the heavy cart; we were 13½
hours on the road, stopped two hours at noon,
and only accomplished about thirty miles. We
put up at Kwa Yo Erh, where, as at all small
places, the people were civility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span> itself, our landlord
even turning his family out of his own
house in order to lodge us comfortably.</p>

<p class="right-indent p2">
<i>14th May.</i>
</p>

<p>We took care that our host, who combined
the profession of military officer with that of
innkeeper, should not lose by his civility, and
we parted with mutual expressions of goodwill.
We had a climb of it up a steepish hill, on the
top of which is a temple to the god of war,
and then descended on to the valley of Ku Pei
Ko̔u by a winding road cut in stages over a
precipice such as one finds on a large scale in
Switzerland and the Tyrol. More than once
on our journey through these mountains I have
been put in mind of the Alps, not only by the
scenery which, if it were not for the absence of
snow and glaciers, would stand the comparison
well, but also by the goitres and cretinism
which seem to be the curse of mountainous
districts. The other day at a cross-road I
asked the way of a man who was collecting
dung for fuel; he turned round and said very
simply, “I know nothing, I’m only an idiot;
ask him,” pointing to a man ploughing, “he
knows everything.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span> Deafness, too, seems
rather common, probably owing to the very
hard weather which prevails during some seven
months of the year. The old people seem
hearty enough, barring their hearing. I came
across none of a very advanced age, but one
old fellow of seventy-nine was very hearty, and
to all appearance likely to remain so, but he
was by many years the <i lang="fr">doyen</i> of all I met, and
anything past seventy seems to be looked upon
as extraordinary.</p>

<p>We had a scorching ride to-day: there was
a good deal of electricity in the air, which told
upon us when we had been some hours in the
saddle. As we were a full hour ahead of our
baggage we turned the horses to graze, and sat
down by a brook to smoke a cigar. As luck
would have it we had no matches; however,
there was a house not far off, so the
doctor volunteered to go and beg a light.
On arriving at the cottage he found forty
or fifty people engaged in a “white affair,”
which is the euphemism for a funeral, because
white is the colour of mourning. A dozen
or so of the relations, friends, and neighbours
were seated round a bier weeping and
crooning officially, while the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span> others, waiting till
their turn came for grief, were smoking their
pipes and retailing country gossip. They were
very civil, and presently—for apparently the
attraction of seeing the foreigners was superior
to that of mourning by commission for a poor
old woman—all, except those actually on duty
round the coffin, were crowding about us as
merry as possible; even the women with their
heads bound up in white cloth as if they
had the face-ache turned out to have a peep
at us from behind the house, grinning and
giggling as if they were assisting at a marriage.</p>

<p>We did not go into the town of Ku Pei Ko̔u,
but stopped at an inn just outside the gates; so
we had all the advantage of the fine view over
the Great Wall of China, with pure air to
breathe, instead of the garlic and muck-stained
atmosphere of the town.</p>

<p>During the whole of our journey from
Llama Miao to Ku Pei Ko̔u we did not see a
single Mongol, much less a camp. The ground
is not suited to their nomad and pastoral habits;
it is colonised exclusively by Chinese, principally
farmers from the province of Shantung.
Europeans have very rarely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span> followed this route;
so far as I can make out they have been seen
here once, or at most twice.</p>

<p class="right-indent p2">
<i>15th May.</i>
</p>

<p>This day week we were shivering in furs at
Llama Miao. To-day a gauze shirt was too
much; the flies were a perfect pest. It was
too hot to do anything but sleep, which they
put out of the question. It was not until after
dinner that we could venture out. We went up
a hill behind the inn, from which we had a fine
view of the sun setting behind the heights which
the Great Wall scales. In the valley beneath
wayfarers were hurrying to reach the town
before the closing of the gates; the rear was
brought up by a herd of about a hundred pigs,
the last travellers who entered China this night
by the gates of Ku Pei Ko̔u.</p>

<p>About Ku Pei Ko̔u and the road back to
Peking I wrote to you last year, and this letter
is too long already. Three days brought us
home to the Legation.</p>

<p><i>P.S.</i>—By the bye, although the part of
Mongolia we visited is set down on the maps
as belonging to the province of Chi Li, which
it is so far as its government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span> is concerned, I
have spoken of <i>China</i> as bounded by the
Great Wall. No Mongol living beyond it
would consider himself as an inhabitant of
China, and the Chinese themselves speak of
the places which are “Ko̔u-wai,” outside the
mouth or frontier, as Mongolia. In Stamford’s
large map of China and Japan you will see
how Chang Chia Ko̔u, Dolonor or Llama Miao,
and Ku Pei Ko̔u are placed—some of our other
halting-places are also given, but you would
hardly recognise them from their spelling.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>May 20th—Sunday.</i>—Went round some of
the curiosity shops, where I was shown, among
other things, a wonderful ewer and cover of rock
crystal, about a foot high. I have seen nothing
finer of its kind than the carving. In the days
of Chien Lung the Magnificent, himself a great
patron of art, when a fine piece of rock crystal,
jade, or cornelian was brought in from the
western mountains as tribute, a committee of
taste decided the shape to be given to it, and
fixed upon the artist to whom it should be
entrusted by Imperial Command.</p>

<p><i>May 21.</i>—The pious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span> Chinese are all off
these days making a pilgrimage to a holy
shrine among the hills, called Miao Fêng Shan,
to burn joss-stick as a sovereign prophylactic
against disease and misfortune of all kinds.</p>

<p><i>May 22.</i>—The thermometer standing at
100° in the shade. The heat frightfully
oppressive. Happily on the following day
there came a great thunderstorm, with hailstones
as big as pigeon’s eggs. This cooled
the air. The formation of the hailstones was
curious: a nodule of ice surrounded by a coating
of frozen snow, which in its turn was encased
in ice. Bad for heads!</p>

<p><i>May 27.</i>—An outbreak of the “Heavenly
Flowers,” or smallpox, causes general consternation
and vaccination. Any one who is
opposed to vaccination had better see the
ravages of this horrible disease in an Eastern
city; so common is it that no Chinaman who
has not “put forth the heavenly flowers” is considered
quite complete. It is like distemper
with dogs in Europe.</p>

<p><i>May 29.</i>—Dined with Dr. and Mrs.
Wells Williams at the American Legation, a
handsome and delightful couple now entering
middle age. Dr. Williams,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span> the author of a
Chinese dictionary, and that most encyclopædic
book <i>The Middle Kingdom</i>, is one of the
most learned of sinologues. He began his
career in China as a missionary in the south,
but his great talents rendered him necessary to
the American Government, and he is now
<i lang="fr">chargé d’affaires</i> here. He was very interesting,
talking, among other subjects, on the paper
currency. Bank-notes, it seems, were first introduced
in the days of the Sung dynasty,
during the reign of Shao Hsing (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1170).
At that time copper was scarce, so the Government
issued great notes (Ta Chao) of the value
of 1000 to 5000 copper cash, and small notes
(Hsiao Chao) worth from 100 to 700 cash.
Officers were appointed everywhere to issue and
receive these notes. They were to be renewed
within seven years, and fifteen cash in every
thousand were deducted for the expense of making
them. They were said to be “kung ssŭ
pien,” “convenient both for the public and for
private individuals.” Marco Polo mentions
them with praise.</p>

<p><i>June 1.</i>—My new colleague, Sir Eric
Farquhar, arrived from England. An old
schoolfellow. He <span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>was accompanied by Mr.
Brenchley, a most accomplished traveller, who
seems to have been all over the world, and
being a great naturalist and profound observer,
is a charming companion to boot.</p>

<p><i>June 10.</i>—The last few days have been
occupied in showing Brenchley the lions of
Peking. To-day we went to breakfast at a
fashionable Chinese restaurant, “The House of
Eternal Prosperity,” in the Ta Shih La Erh,
which we call Curio Street. In order that we
might make a genteel appearance and observe
the ten thousand proprieties, my servant Chang
Hsi insisted on our going in carts. Walking is
so vulgar! We were jolted and bruised over
the indescribable ruts and paving-stones to a
horrible degree, but our dignity was kept up.
We found the House of Eternal Prosperity
very shabby and dirty, and we should have had
a much better breakfast at home.</p>

<p><i>June 15–20.</i>—Two more parties of travellers
arrived. More work as “intelligent guide.”</p>

and make the arrangements for his journey
across Siberia to Russia. Ultimately, however,
the party increased to four, of whom one
was a lady, and our programme grew in proportion.
We started on June the 21st. We
were detained four or five days at Chang Chia
Ko̔u, owing to the chicanery of a faithless
Mongol camel-owner who did not keep faith
with us. However, it is a bright, cheerful little
town, so I did not much mind. It was gayer
than ever too, for on account of the great
drought, morning, noon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span> and night, the town
was being paraded by processions of distressed
agriculturists praying for rain. Preceded by
squeaky clarionets, drums, and gongs, a crowd
of men and boys with wreaths of willow round
their heads and middles, above which their sunburnt
bodies were naked, some wearing fillets of
red paper, others doing penance with their necks
enclosed in the heavy board used as a punishment
for prisoners, escorted a sedan chair with
a tiny god in it to the Lung Wang Miao, the
Temple of the Dragon Prince, whom, being a
water-god, it is well to propitiate in cases of
drought.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Some of the votaries were armed
with spears and rude guns, which from time to
time they fired off, and altogether there was din
and clatter enough even to please a Chinese
crowd. “Ah! these agriculturists!” said a
Chinese gentleman who was looking on with
the most supreme contempt, and whom I asked
for an explanation of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>the affair; “they are
never content! It’s always too much rain or
too little, or something the matter. Unsurpassable!”
The prayers of the worthy people were
heard, however, and the Dragon Prince took a
favourable view of their case, for the first day
of my stay at Chang Chia Ko̔u there came a
thunderstorm, with a downfall of rain, such as
one seldom sees out of the tropics, and there
was more or less rain all the time we were
there. The coincidence will not improve the
chances of an American missionary who has
been physicking the natives of Chang Chia Ko̔u
for rather more than a year, but in spite of the
drastic arguments of blue pill and black dose,
has not yet made a convert.</p>

<p>There are three main passes leading from
China into Mongolia, Chang Chia Ko̔u, Ku Pei
Ko̔u, and between them Tu Shih Ko̔u, which is
smaller and less important, but which I had
not seen. The plan which I proposed, and
which my companions accepted, was to make a
tour of the three, following a line outside, but
in some parts parallel with the Great Wall.</p>

<p>We left Chang Chia Ko̔u on the 30th of
June. It was frightfully hot, but I had provided
a refuge against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span> scorching sun, which
at mid-day would have been unbearable. We
each had with us a mule litter, a sort of long
carriage in which a single person can almost lie
at full length, with shafts behind and before
which are borne on mules’ backs. This sounds
rather a comfortable and luxurious way of
travelling, seeing that one’s bed and pillows
are placed inside. As a fact it is horridly jolty
and sea-sicky; then no sooner has one established
one’s self in a tolerably easy position and
dozed off (which is inevitable, and makes one
very hot and uncomfortable), than one is called
upon by the muleteer to trim the boat: “Your
Excellency! please sit a little more to the south.
Your Excellency’s weight is all to the north!
The north side of that mule’s back is becoming
terribly galled.” My muleteer was a very
original character. He had a prodigious talent
for screaming out Chinese anacreontics at the
top of his voice, and for dramatic recitations
and imitations of popular actors. He was
always the last of the muleteers to get up in the
morning, and when at last I took to waking
him with the crack of a hunting-whip, he only
grumbled good-humouredly and said the “old
lord,” meaning me, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span> very hard upon him,
but none the more did he get up to feed his
mules. He had been to Mongolia once with
Sir Frederic Bruce, to whom he applied the most
glowing eulogy that a Chinaman can bestow, holding
up his thumb; words could go no further.
Altogether Cha Mai Chu—that is his name—was
the merriest, grinningest, and most laughable
devil that I have ever come across here. When
we arrived at the inn, and the six muleteers,
having acquiesced in the landlord’s civil proposal,
“You six gentlemen” (if you could but see
the six gentlemen!) “will dine together, I suppose,”
had sat down to the coarse fare, a sort
of macaroni with garlic and pickles, which
they allow themselves, Cha Mai Chu used to
keep the other five in a roar of laughter, and I
rather think that by that means he contrived to
suck up the lion’s share of the white strings.</p>

<p>As the first part of our road, as far as Chang-Ma-Tzŭ-Chin,
was but a repetition of the
same journey which I wrote about in my last
long letter describing my expedition to Llama
Miao, I spare you the repetition. Farther
on we followed a route new to me, and in
some places not visited before by foreigners.
This may interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span> you. After leaving
Chang-Ma-Tzŭ-Chin on the 3rd July, instead of
pushing on northwards across Mongolia, which
at this season is far more worthy of its Chinese
name, “The Land of Grass,” than it was
two months ago, we steered south-east back
towards China, across a sandy plain, richly
cultivated with potatoes and other crops. In
the midst of this sandy tract stands a little
tumble-down Chinese village called Lien Hwa
Tan, “the lotus-flower fountain,” from an
old tradition that there once stood there a temple
in which was a fountain flourishing with lotus-flowers.
Now it is a case of <i lang="la">lucus a non</i>, for
temple, fountain, and flowers have all faded
away together, and as for anything flourishing,
there was barely a roof for us to eat our breakfasts
under. We were making for a ridge of
green hills, from the top of which I expected to
come in sight of the Great Wall, which, however,
did not appear until we had reached the bottom
of an emerald-green valley, with luxuriant vegetation,
lying between rugged and bare rocks.
Hard by Tu Shih Ko̔u the great brick monster
showed itself again, but in ruins, undermined
and sapped by continual watercourses. The
rocks here are very fine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span> picturesque and
astonishing in their shapes. Tu Shih Ko̔u itself
is a queer little old town. The fortifications
and walls are falling into decay, uncared for
and unrepaired. In a few years, I should think,
its quaint gables and towers and useless fortifications
will have crumbled away; but on the other
hand, inside the walls there are shops, neat and
tidy, and houses showing signs of some prosperity.
Perhaps, after all, there is some method
in the apparent madness of letting the old
remains of protection against border warfare
go to the dogs. I have often told you how
bothered travellers are here on arriving at an
inn by gapers and starers. The nuisance was
multiplied a hundred-fold on this excursion by
the fact of our having a lady with us. I was
armed with special letters of recommendation
from the Ministers of Foreign Affairs to the high
mandarins along the road, and as soon as these
last heard that we were annoyed, they hastened
to send us “po-po” (sweetmeats) and protection,
but before this arrived I had been obliged to
take the law into my own hands, for three dirty,
old, gray blackguards had actually, using their
wet thumbs as centre-bits, made holes in one
of our paper windows,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span> at which they were
playing peeping Tom, and so interested by
what they saw that they did not hear Retribution
stealing up on tiptoe armed with a hunting-whip.
Retribution, that is myself, tied their
three nasty old tails together and packed them
off howling, to the great delight of their friends
and relations, who quite recognised the breach
of Tao Li of which they had been guilty. An
appeal to Tao Li, good manners, or propriety,
is always a trump card to play when in difficulties
with a Chinese crowd.</p>

<p>We only stayed one night at Tu Shih Ko̔u,
and then rode back through another pass to the
fresh air of the steppe. We passed the night at
a little hamlet called Chang Leang. There was
but one inn, and that was full, and we should
have had to pass the night <i lang="it">al fresco</i> if a good-natured
Bachelor of Arts returning from Llama
Miao to Tu Shih Ko̔u had not consented to
push on and give us up his room for the lady
of our party. The rest of us managed to
huddle up somehow. Never in all my wanderings
here have I had to sleep in such queer
places as I did on this journey. The villages
were poor, the inns worse; and instead of
having the high place,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span> we males were bound
to put up with holes such as the very beggars
in England would back out of. However, the
game was worth the candle so far as scenery
was concerned, and then the air of Mongolia
makes up for everything. Even the Alpine
Club do not know what fresh air is; they must
come to the steppes.</p>

<p>The next day we breakfasted at a felt
manufactory, at a village called Ta Tan. The
way the Chinese make their felt is very rude
and primitive, but the result beats Manchester
and cogwheels. A quantity of wool is carded
and weighed and scattered evenly over a rush
mat. When a sufficient quantity has been
laid, the wool is carefully flattened down with
a sort of wickerwork fan and sprinkled with
boiling water; the mat and wool are then
rolled up and tied, and the roll being laid on
the ground is kicked backwards and forwards
by six men from foot to foot for five minutes.
A second layer completes the felt, which is
excellent. I wish I could give you an idea of
the extreme beauty of our afternoon’s ride.
After we had left our felt manufactory, the
road lay through low hills, along a valley that
was perfectly enamelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span> with wild-flowers,
principally yellow ones, a real blaze of gold—wild
roses, ranunculus, amaryllis, peony, daphne,
potentilla, pinks, purple iris, gorgeous tiger and
Turk’s cap lilies, and poppies which pay the
Emperor of China the compliment of wearing
his colours, besides a host of others—a mass
of beauties. A violent contrast to the richness
of the pasture are the herds of camels,
who at this time of year, coatless, mangy,
emaciated, and so weak as hardly to be able
to move along, are turned out to get rid of
the sores on their backs and recruit for their
hard work in autumn, winter, and spring.
Poor brutes! pitiable as they look, this must
be the happiest season of their year; they well
earn their rest. Along this wild garden we
gradually ascended—so gradually that it was
not until we had reached the top of the pass
that opens out between two rocks on a panorama
of high hills, range upon range lying
at our feet, that we had any idea how high
we were. I think this view as I saw it, with
the sun setting in the distance and the remains
of a storm rolling away over the mountains,
is one of the finest I have ever seen. The
mountains themselves are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span> savage and barren,
and in the valleys clusters of trees mark where
Chinese homesteads stand, so poor that not
even eggs are to be bought there. In one of
these, at a place called Pa Ti, half farmhouse,
half inn, we slept, I in a sort of barn, my bed
on the ground, my dressing-table a nether millstone,
and my washhand-stand the carcase of
an old cart. The sun was rising when we
started down the valley, which really is the
grandest thing I have seen in China, and
barring the attractions of snow and ice, it
seems to me the Alps have nothing finer to
show. Rocks more grim and uncouth there
cannot be. They take every conceivable shape—men’s
heads, tigers, lions, citadels with turrets
and battlements of living rock, are easily conjured
up. Then there are huge boulders that
look as if a breath would blow them down,
so delicately are they poised upon points
apparently quite unfit to bear their weight.
It is a valley which makes one think of old
fairy tales about giants and dwarfs and ogres’
castles. The poor commonplace Chinese
drudges who inhabit it are ill-suited to their
home. The best part of the scenery ends
some fifteen miles down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span> valley, at a hill
called Llama Shan (“The Llama’s Hills”)—two
enormous pyramidical rocks, at the foot of
which is a village to which they give their
name. On one rock, high upon a flat surface
hard to climb to, is painted a rude picture of
Buddha, with a glory round his head and his
finger and thumb held up in orthodox form.
The painting is of old date, but pious hands
have recently restored it. In the other rock
is a cave in which a rather hazy tradition says
that in old times a llama or llamas used to
retire from the world, and pass their time in
the pious contemplation of their own navels.
Their reverences showed their taste in the
choice of their abode, for it is a lovely spot.
We were spoilt for the lower half of the valley
by the beauty of the upper half, but we had
still before us a fine jagged hill, at the foot of
which is Ta Kao, our halting-place, a largish
town, rich in gardens. And what would
Exeter Hall say if it heard that there are
places in these parts which actually cultivate
their own poppies? We found a famous inn
at Ta Kao, with large rooms freshly papered;
but strange to say, on the 6th of July, the
stove-beds or kangs <span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>were all heated. We,
coming from the cool mountain breezes, found
the atmosphere of itself close and stuffy, though
in comparison with Peking it was freshness
itself; the heated kangs were perfectly insupportable.
We wound up a long day with
the usual exhibition to a rather tiresome crowd.</p>

<p>We travelled next day along a poverty-stricken
but picturesque valley, through which
flows a mountain torrent swelled almost to a
river by the recent rains. We had to ford it
twenty-two times in the course of the day. At
one ford one of the mule litters broke down and
was smashed to pieces. No great damage was
done, and the mule litter was patched together
with bits of string and an old nail or two. The
way in which the muleteer abused his beasts for
the mishap was very funny. Treating the mule
as if it had been a human creature, he proceeded
in his wrath to take away its younger sister’s
character. Be it man or mule, horse or pig, or
what not, that sins against a Chinese, he immediately
tramples on the fair fame of the younger
sister of the offender, heaping upon her every foul
abuse that he can lay his tongue to. Mingled
with his revilings, the muleteer addressed the
most humble petitions <span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>to me not to dock his
pay, passing from prayer to abuse with wondrous
facility. If that mule’s younger sister
was guilty of one-half the enormities ascribed to
her, the punishment has not yet been devised
which would be equal to the occasion. The
list of her crimes is not fit for publication.
When we arrived at Chai Ling the only room
that I could have was perfectly untenable from
stuffiness and a hot kang which took up a good
half of it, so I slept in my litter in the inn-yard,
<i lang="la">sub Jove</i>, which was very cool and pleasant.</p>

<p>The following morning, 8th July, we were
awakened by a most glorious sunrise; it was so
fresh and nice that I walked the greater part of
the day’s journey, to the undisguised wonder of
the muleteers, who could not in the least understand
it. They hold up their thumbs in admiration,
and loudly express their high respect for
such prowess. “See the old lord! how he
walks!” “He has obtained to walk unsurpassably.”
“This body! Our lords here have
not such bodies!” It was but a ten-mile walk;
but no Chinese gentleman would dream of
attempting such a feat. We all went beetle-mad
this day, one of our party being an entomologist.
Under one jujube-tree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span> we found so
many varieties of insects of different kinds that
it became perfectly exciting; even the muleteers
caught the fever and began to take a
certain interest in the hunt, but were rather
afraid of the quarry. At the end of a
very pretty mountain walk we found the “Inn
of Flourishing Righteousness,” with a large
yard full of picturesque groups of half-naked
drovers and muleteers. We were well lodged
and very comfortable.</p>

<p>The next morning we came down the pass
on to Ku Pei Ko̔u, which I found as attractive
as ever. I put up at my old quarters outside
the town. Of course we rested a day to let the
travellers have a ramble on the Great Wall.
While they were busy picking up bricks and
ferns and other souvenirs of the Great Wall, I
fell in with a curious character. He was an old
Chinaman, by name Li, by trade a herbalist and
naturalist, by adoption a poultry-fancier, and by
inspiration a professor of palmistry. He began
by telling me a lot of curious facts and properties
about different plants and roots, but as their
English names were unknown to me I cannot
repeat them. Certain of them were to cure the
hot, others to repel the cold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span> influence. Lizards
he pointed to as a deadly poison (internal) to
horses and cattle. After he had discoursed to
me some time, he asked to look at my hand;
and then he really surprised me. He told me
things about myself and family which are certainly
known to few people but ourselves; that
they should have become known to a poor
cottager living on a hillside near a little out-of-the-way
town at the farther extremity of Asia is
impossible. We shall see if what he said about
the future is equally correct. The lines in the
hand from which he gathered his auguries were
different from those which used to be read in
Europe; he explained his science to me, but as
he did so in verse, and in the jargon of the trade,
I could not make much of it. He invited me
afterwards to his cottage—such a pretty little
spot, with a glorious vine trained so as to make a
covered Pergola in front of it. He passes his life
here contentedly, seldom going to the town but
when he needs to sell his herbs or his chickens.
As soon as he made his appearance with me a
whole pack of dirty little brats, all stark naked,
came trooping out to welcome him and salute
their father’s guest according to manners.</p>

<p>I had hoped to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span> pushed so far as Jo
Hol, the imperial palace and hunting forest, but
one of my companions struck work, and I was
obliged to return to Peking, having been within
two days of my goal, which I hope, however,
to reach another time.</p>

<p class="right-indent">
<span class="smcap">Ta-chio-Ssŭ</span>, <i>4th August 1866</i>.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I returned from Mongolia three weeks
ago I found that all the world, that is to say,
the three or four diplomatists who compose our
world, had very wisely taken itself off to the
country. So early as last February I had
secured this “Temple of Great Repose,” and I
lost no time in coming out here. It is too far
from Peking to be very convenient; but it is
well worth the extra ride, and the advantage of
being fifteen miles from the other temples
inhabited by Europeans is incalculable; one is
not subject to perpetual interruptions by people
who, being bored themselves, come in and
inflict their boredom upon others. It is a great
undertaking moving out to the hills. We are
obliged to take absolutely our whole <i lang="fr">ménage</i>,
and almost all our furniture with us. I think
you would have laughed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span> at my procession;
there were fourteen carts full of every kind of
movable—our whole poultry-yard clucking and
cackling out of coops and baskets, and a cow
with her calf. This must seem strange to
you, who would certainly not dream of taking
your hens, ducks, and cows with you from
town to the country: it is only another instance
of the universal topsy-turviness of things in
China, again demonstrated by the fact that
the farther one gets from town the dearer
everything becomes, there being no market
and no competition, so that the owner of a
leg of mutton can just charge what he pleases
for it, knowing that you must either buy at his
price or go without it altogether. It is a beautiful
ride out here, past Hai Tien, a little village
with a smart inn at which the Pekingese may
be seen by scores, naked to the waist, and
enjoying an outing, after their fashion, with
chopsticks and rice, tea and infinitesimal pipes,
past Yuen Ming Yuen and Wan Shao Shan, or
rather its ruins, past flourishing cornfields and
picturesque hamlets, past temples and shrines
innumerable, along stony roads which the rains
have turned into canals so deep that the carters
are obliged to cast lots for which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span> shall strip his
very dirty body and go in to see whether the
carts can pass or not. It was quite dark before
I reached the temple, after eight hours’ ride
under the hottest sun I ever remember to have
felt. Indeed I had a sad proof of its strength
the next day, for my brown pony, Hop-o’-my-thumb,
who had carried me so well over so
many hundred miles, died of sunstroke after a
few hours’ illness. Poor little beast! He was
a great pet, and as fond of me as a dog. When
I went down to his stable shortly before he
died he put his head on my shoulder and looked
so piteously in my face. The Chinese veterinary
surgeon (they are rather clever at that)
declares that he was struck by the sun the day
before while he was being led. He was the
strongest, stoutest little beast you ever saw,
never sick nor sorry, and used to trot into
Peking after a 700-mile journey as if he had
just been out for a morning’s exercise. He is
the third horse that I have lost from one cause
or another since last September. Bad luck, is
it not?</p>

<p>This is certainly the prettiest temple and the
most charming summer residence that I have
seen near Peking. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span> temple stands in a
nest of trees—cedars, pines, firs, and poplars—a
perpetual fountain runs through all its courts,
and there seems always to be a cool breeze
blowing. While our friends are complaining of
being roasted and baked in their temples, we
here are revelling in fresh air. Here is a
translation of an account of Ta Chio Ssŭ by a
Chinese gentleman:—</p>

<p>“Seventy li (23 miles) from the walls of
Peking there stood in the time of the Liao a
temple called Ling Chuan Ssŭ, ‘The temple
of the Spiritual Fountain.’ In the reign of the
Emperor Hsuan Tê of the Ming dynasty it
was restored, and the name changed to Ta
Chio Ssŭ, ‘The temple of Great Repose.’ There
are four shrines: the first is to the Prince of
heaven; the second to Ju Lai Fo, the Buddha
who reigns in the western heaven; the third to
the Yo Shih Fo, the Buddha who presides over
medicine; and the fourth and last shrine has
an upper story, and in it is the Pu-sa (god of
the second class) of Great Compassion. Behind
the shrines is a pond with a fountain. In this
is a dragon’s head carved in stone, out of the
mouth of which the spring issues. In front of
the pond is a pagoda, on <span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>the left and right
hands of which are old fir-trees, one on each
side, about which an old tradition says that
they never can overtop the pagoda, hence the
spot is called ‘Sung ta chi,’ or ‘The firs and
pagoda level.’ Besides this, outside the shrine
of the Prince of heaven, on either side there is
a stone called the dragon stone and the tiger
stone, from their resemblance to those animals.
In front of these there is a stone bridge with a
pond of water on each side, and in the ponds
there are a fountain and lotus flowers and gold
fish. By the side of the ponds is a dragon’s
claw tree, in the shape of lions playing, whence
it is called the Lion Tree. The temple is built
on the west, facing the east; on its south side
is an imperial residence called Ssŭ Yi Tang,
‘The Hall of the Four Proprieties.’ In the hall
stands an imperial throne. In the garden are
four trees—peonies and two Yu Lan Hwa trees,
magnolias. Behind this hall is the ‘Pavilion
of the Reposing Clouds,’ ‘Chi Yün Hsuan,’ in
front of which are bright bamboos and dark
green firs interlaced like a forest, a capital refuge
from the heat in midsummer, with plenty to see.”</p>

<p>My friend Liu, who wrote the description
which I have translated above,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span> has left out one
of the greatest charms of the place. Just
behind the “Pavilion of the Reposing Clouds,”
in which we live, is a most beautiful rock work,
all covered with tufts of feathery grass, mosses,
and ferns, and lycopods: down this and into
an artificial basin, which is screened from
the sun by a network of fir branches, comes
tumbling a deliciously cool fountain scented
with pine needles, which gives us a famous
shower-bath twice a day—a real luxury. Close
by my fountain is a little summer-house, in
which the Emperor Chien Lung was transacting
business one day with his ministers, and feeling
inspired by the influence of the place got
through his work greatly to his satisfaction,
so he called the summer-house “The Pavilion
of the Understanding of Important Matters.” I
wonder whether I have given you an idea of
what a very pretty place this is? It is almost
enough to tempt a man to turn Buddhist priest,
and abstracting himself from the unrealities of
this life, pass his hour on earth in reflecting
upon the beauties of the hopelessly unattainable
Nirvana (I don’t suppose you know what
that is—so much the better. It will be like
that “blessed word Mesopotamia”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span> to the old
woman at church). The only pity is that
mosquitoes and sand-flies sound such a lively
recall to the reality of the disagreeable.</p>

<p>The monastery is richly endowed with lands,
so much so as to be independent of the assistance
from Government, to which, as an imperial
temple, it would be entitled. The place looks
richer than most of the temples about here.
There is no magnificence, but it has a comfortable,
well-to-do appearance, the grounds
and buildings being properly kept up. All
over the gardens there are notices to “relations
and friends” who may visit the temple to abstain
from damaging buildings and trees, plucking
flowers or cutting down the bamboos, a notice
the spirit of which, as it says, “all respectable
persons will observe of their own accord, and
those who do not will be fined.” First and
last, monks and laymen, there are some fifty
persons employed about the temple. The
abbot himself finds it dull, so he remains at
Peking enjoying himself. His second in command
is a charming monk, very clean in his
person and especially natty about his boots. He
is very intelligent, too, and comes and sits with
me by the hour talking Buddhism.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span> This is an
extremely religious temple—prayers, liturgies,
drum and gong beating, seem to be going on
very constantly. But except on the 1st and
15th of every moon and other holidays the
novices are put on active service, the monks
enjoying an unbroken idleness; they are
apparently cursed with an unquenchable thirst,
but as a fountain of perennial tea flows for them
they are not to be pitied. I suppose you would
ask the name of my friend with the neat boots;
this would be an arch mistake and violation of
good-breeding on your part. When a man
shaves his tail and turns monk he cuts himself
off from the whole world, including his family,
whose name even he no longer bears. To
remind him of this would be quite ill-bred, but
as it is inconvenient that a monk—who, however
much he may renounce the vanities of this
life, must occasionally be brought in contact
with that extremely unreal idea, the world—should
have no designation at all, he adopts
two words or characters as his appellation,
which on no account must you call his name.
You ask him what is his “honourable above
and below”; this refers to the two characters,
one of which is written above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span> the other. My
friend’s “honourable above and below” is Fo
Kwo. As a Buddhist monk must not be asked
his name, so a Taoist monk must not be asked
his age, although it is one of the complimentary
routine questions in China.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood round about here is as
charming as the place itself. The fields are
richly cultivated; there is plenty of hedge-row
timber, and the villages are very picturesque
and well shaded. The hills are beautifully
shaped, and take fine colours of an evening.
The one thing wanting is water, which is missing
all over this part of China. Nothing can
be prettier than the cottages of the villagers
with their long, low eaves; each has its little
garden hedged in by a fence of tall millet, over
which are trained gourds and other creepers.
There is generally, too, a millet-straw shed with
a vine creeping about it, and under this the
labourers sit of an evening and drink their tea,
a picture of contentment. The temples, both
Taoist and Buddhist, are numerous. Yesterday
I scrambled up to a very pretty one on the top
of a great eminence so steep that it is called by
the Chinese the “Wall Mountain.” I found a
most charming little monastery <span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>built in tiers, I
should have said terraces had it not been
so tiny, which reminded me of the tiers of
the Rhenish vineyards. Their reverences the
monks had all gone off to Peking on a lark, but
I was hospitably entertained with tea by two
lay attendants, for whose benefit I in return
emptied my cigar-case. What a queer existence
these people lead perched up on the top
of a high hill! They are so stay-at-home that
they hardly seem to care even to go down on
to the plain. And as to going to Peking, none
but the better-to-do monks dream of such
dissipation. You may imagine what a state
of crass ignorance they live in. For faces
expressing brutal stupidity there is nothing to
equal the Chinese monks, except the Thibetan
llamas, between whom and drivelling idiotcy
there is no missing link. My friend here,
Fo Kwo, is a brilliant exception. Monks
and laymen alike—all our neighbours—vie
with one another in civility to us. They
all stop one to have a chat, and as for tea,
I might drown myself in a butt of it if I had
a mind. The women, however—and in one
village there are some very pretty ones—are
as <i lang="fr">farouches</i> as wild deer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span> As I ride in at
one end of a village I see them scuttling off
into their houses, with their babies on their
backs, as fast as their poor deformed feet will
let them. If by chance I overtake them, they
scowl at me as if I really were the devil they
call me. During the whole time I have been
in China, I do not think that I have three times
been addressed by Chinese women; the rare
exceptions have always been wrinkled old hags—of
course I do not count beggars. <i lang="fr">Ces dames</i>
don’t love us. They are always the first to get
up the cry of “Kwei tzŭ” (devils) against us,
and I almost think that they verily believe that
there is something uncanny about us, or at any
rate that there is no villainy of which we are
not capable. However, I think that last year I
told you some of their beliefs with respect to us.</p>

<p>Farquhar joined me on the 20th July, bringing
with him Dr. Pogojeff from the Russian
summer quarters at Pa Ta Chu—a group of
temples nearer Peking, where most of the
Legations spend the hot season. They are
delighted with the beauty of this place. Farquhar,
who is a very clever artist, has made
some lovely sketches. July the 25th was the
fifteenth day of the Chinese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span> moon, a high day
with our Buddhist friends. On ordinary days
the novices do the drum and gong beating, and
intone the prayers (which indeed never seem to
cease), but on the 1st and 15th of each moon
the higher priests—whose everyday duties seem
to be confined to smoking infinite and infinitesimal
pipes of tobacco, and sipping cup
after cup of amber tea—buckle to the work
themselves, leaving their ease and dignity to
don their black and yellow robes, and perform
service with the rest.</p>

<p>One day out walking we were accosted by
a man who told us that he was out for a holiday,
and insisted on taking us with him to a village
where there was “Jo nao” (fun) going on. We
could not resist, so we went with him, and in
a by-lane of the said village, on one of the
threshing-floors, we found a small raised stage.
After we had waited some time, during which
the whole village had time to turn out for a
good stare at us, a man made his appearance
with a very small drum, three pairs of castanets,
and three gongs. He was followed by three
ladies—one old and two young, and all hideous—and
then the performance began with an
instrumental overture by the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>whole strength of
the company, a rattling and jangling which
lasted five minutes, and sent us off with our
fingers in our ears. We gave the poor people
a dollar and were glad to escape; but the
villagers were highly delighted, for were not
these real actors come all the way from Peking,
and, therefore, of course eminent? Mario and
Grisi, starring in the provinces, never gave
more pleasure to a country audience.</p>

<p>Frightfully hot weather. Do you remember
the old quatrain written with a diamond on a
pane of glass in the old Foreign Office in
Downing Street:—</p>

<p>Copying despatches with the thermometer at
100° in the shade, with a basin of water and
a towel at one’s side for very necessary hand-wiping,
and a pad of blotting-paper over the
blank part of one’s paper, is indeed an <i lang="fr">affreux
métier</i>.</p>

<p>I find that Englishmen who can’t speak the
language are a little capricious as to exchanging
courtesies which the Chinese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span> press upon
them. Sometimes it amuses them immensely
to stop and talk twaddle with the natives
through an interpreter, while at others,
especially if there is just a touch of headache
in the case, the Chinamen get short answers.
To-day as we were walking we passed a
group of peasants, one of whom as usual called
out civilly, “Hsie yi hsie pa?” (Won’t you sit
down a bit?)</p>

<p><i>F.</i>—“What the devil’s he saying?”</p>

<p><i>Chinaman</i> (thinking to be intelligible by
being still louder)—“Hsie yi hsie pa!”</p>

<p><i>F.</i>—“Don’t make that damned noise!”</p>

<p><i>I.</i>—“He’s only asking you to sit down.”</p>

<p><i>F.</i> (savagely)—“Well, he needn’t make
such a confounded row about it!”</p>

<p><i>Chinaman</i> (to his friends)—“The gentleman
is not very quiet,” as if he were speaking
of a restive horse.</p>

<p><i>Friends</i> (assenting)—“Ah! these foreigners!
they are indeed terrible people. Unsurpassable!
unsurpassable!”</p>

<p>The poor villagers would have been too
civil to utter their opinion if they had thought
they were understood, but I had held my
tongue to hear what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span> they would say.</p>

<p>On the 16th of August we had a delightful
addition to our family party in the shape of
my old friend Dick Conolly, who has come
out as second secretary—the cheeriest of companions.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Next day he and I rode over to see a very
famous temple, Hei Lung Tan, a shrine
dedicated to the Black Dragon, which was
built in the Ming dynasty and repaired in
Ka̔ng Hsi’s reign. It is an imposing edifice
built in three tiers with roofs of the imperial
yellow tiles. Here the Black Dragon Prince
rests in great dignity. He is surrounded by
six satellites—a monster who presides over
the thunder, a woman who rules the lightning,
a clerk with pen and book who writes down
orders for the rainfall, and three others whose
functions are not so clear. Of human attendants
there was visible but one priest, very dirty and
saturated with garlic. The Black Dragon
being, like all dragons in this country, a water
deity or spirit, there is of course a pond in
which he may disport himself. If his priest
would only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span> do the same!</p>

<p>The country people are really very civil and
kind. The other day we were wandering
through a village nestled away among the hills,
when several of the peasants came out and
brought us delicious pears. One old gentleman,
a personage evidently, was just preparing
a great sacrifice outside his house to ward off
the devil. He had erected an altar on which
were placed various fruits and grapes, and in
front of it was a great paper boat with dolls in
it. This was to be burnt, and with the letting
off of many crackers would complete the sacrifice.
This, it appears, being the 15th day of
the 7th moon, is the feast of departed spirits—a
sort of All Souls’ Day. It is the anniversary
on which the pious Chinaman worships and
burns incense at the tombs of his ancestors—the
custom over which the Dominicans and
Franciscans on the one side, and the Jesuits on
the other, started their great feud in the days
of the Emperor Ka̔ng Hsi.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> There are also
on this day great ceremonies in honour of
the tutelary saints of towns, some deceased
minister or warrior appointed by the Emperor
as guardian over each <span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>town or part of a
town. Great honour is paid to one of these
patron saints, and men will flock to his shrine
to dedicate themselves to his service, so that a
man, for instance, who is a groom in this life,
will go and offer himself to be the saint’s groom
in the next world. The effigy of this “Lord
of the Walls,” as he is called, is paraded through
the town where he is supposed to search out
evil-doers. There is also a Prince of departed
spirits whose shrine is largely attended on this
day. A stage is raised and priests are engaged
to read prayers and distribute food for the
spirits, that those who have died a violent
death may be released from Purgatory. At
midnight huge paper images, placed in a boat
in order that the spirits may pass the river Nai-ho,
a sort of Styx, are solemnly burnt, and
the feast is over. The feast is called Yu
Lang Hai, “The assembly of the Bowl and
Flower.” My teacher explains this, saying
that on board the boat there is a Buddhist god
called Ti Tsang Wang, who gives the ghosts
of the departed a bowl and flower as a token of
release from their sins, so that they may cross
the river which is a gulf between them and
Paradise.</p>

</div>

<p class="right-indent">
<span class="smcap">Peking</span>, <i>7th September 1866</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> time ago I was invited to go to the play
by the great curio merchant here—Han Chang-kwei-ti.
As the Pekingese theatres have a
great celebrity, I ought to give you some
account of them.</p>

<p>There are a great many theatres in the
Chinese city, their situation being marked by
a few masks, lay figures, images of tortoises or
dragons, or other queer beasts; though indeed
no sign is necessary to indicate their whereabouts,
for the infernal din which comes from
them the whole day long would guide any one
to them. The theatres are the property of
restaurateurs, who engage a company of actors
to come and play for so many days, so that the
troupes are constantly changing quarters. You
go in by a long passage, which leads into a lofty
and spacious hall, lighted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span> from the top, and
surrounded by a gallery. In the pit, or body of
the hall, are tables at which the people sit
drinking tea, eating sweetmeats, or with papers
of fried melon and gourd seeds before them.
This is the place of the poorer people; the rank
and fashion go to the gallery, part of which is
divided into private boxes. At one end of the
hall is a raised platform, without scenes or
appliances of any kind, open at the sides, and
separated from the dressing-room by two doors
with curtains; at the back of the stage sit the
orchestra, five or six performers, all of whom
play upon several instruments, which they take
up in turn, according to the character of the
music. The chief instruments are fiddles, lutes,
clarionets, flutes, a sort of mouth organ, and
any number of variety of gongs, drums, and
cymbals. I talk of fiddles, etc., for simplicity’s
sake, but you know a Chinese fiddle is no more
like a European fiddle than a Chinaman with
his pig-tail is like a European in a chimney-pot
hat.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more rude or primitive
than the state of the drama. The tragedies
are all strutting and mouthing; roaring in a
bass voice that seems <span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>to come out of the
actor’s boots, or squeaking in a falsetto shrill
enough to set your teeth on edge. The whole
of the words are declaimed in a sort of recitative,
which is more than half drowned by
the drums and gongs. The language of tragedies
is the old literary style and very obscure,
and as if to make it still more difficult to the
Pekingese, the actors all affect the Soochow
dialect as the mother-tongue of the stage.
The consequence of this is that even a well-educated
Chinaman will make a very poor
guess at the plot unless he has read the tragedy
beforehand. Not understanding what is going
on does not, however, seem to affect the enjoyment
of the audience, nine-tenths of whom
could no more tell you what the play is all
about than I could.</p>

<p>As there is no scenery or stage appliances a
great deal must be supplied by the imagination.
A lady coming in with an attendant in the plain
clothes of a Pekingese coolie, holding horizontally
on each side of her two flags on which
are painted wheels and clouds, is a fairy entering
in her chariot of clouds. A warrior brandishes
a whip to show that he is on horseback; to
dismount, he makes a pirouette<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span> on one leg and
throws down his whip; to remount, he makes a
pirouette on the other leg and picks it up again.
But let me tell you the plot of the tragedy I
saw, as Han Chang-kwei-ti explained it to me.</p>

<p>A warrior in white has an everlasting feud
with a rebel in red, who always gets the
better of him, and performs the most astounding
<i lang="fr">pas seuls</i>, making quite appalling faces
(heightened by streaks of red, blue, and white
paint) to the terror of the whole empire, as
represented by five old men and two little boys
in white. The warrior in white, after a series
of stage combats with the rebel in red, which it
would break the heart of our best pantomimists
to imitate, sits down in an arm-chair and tucks
up one leg under him, by which the audience
are to understand that he has gone to sleep in
a lonely forest. He then dreams that the ghost
of his father appears to him to teach him a trick
and give him a sword, by the aid of which he
may circumvent the rebel in red. The dream
is represented by his getting up from his chair
and acting through the scene with his father’s
ghost, after which he sits down in the same
posture as before. During one of his dead
father’s speeches, which may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span> have struck him,
as they did me, as rather tedious, the actor felt
a little thirsty, so he called for a cup of tea,
which a coolie brought to him, and he drank it
with his face to the audience, gargling his throat
and spitting out the last mouthful without the
smallest regard for the situation. Well, the
father having stalked out, the warrior tucked up
his leg again and then awoke. A final combat
of many rounds then terminates in the victory
of the warrior, obtained by the grace of his
father’s sword. The rebel is slain and walks
out, and the victorious army, consisting of four
wheezy old men, make a triumphal entry into
the gates of the capital, which are signified by
two coolies holding up two poles with a blue
cotton curtain in which a hole has been cut.</p>

<p>The dresses of the tragedians are magnificent.
They are stiff with gold and embroidery, and
immensely valuable. The masks and painting
of the faces are to the last degree grotesque and
hideous. The beards and wigs are coarse and
clumsily contrived.</p>

<p>After two or three historical pieces have been
played a farce follows, and indeed it is time that
the proceedings should be enlivened a little.
The farces are not difficult to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span> follow (though I
cannot say that I understand writers whom I
know to be ignorant of Chinese, and who say
that the acting of the Pekingese comedians is so
good that the whole play is quite intelligible; I
know I was out of my depth often enough, in
spite of the admirable acting, and of my being
able to understand a great deal of the dialogue).
The dialect is the pure Pekingese vernacular,
and the dialogue is spoken with the exception
of a few songs. The women’s parts are played
by boys, who imitate to perfection the mincing
gait and affectations of the Chinese women—“the
carriage as graceful as the weeping willow”—sham
small feet are attached to their own
boots in order to carry out the illusion, which is
quite perfect. These boys are bought in the
south and trained up as apprentices. They
receive no pay from the head of their troupe, but
they earn largish sums by attending the banquets
of the Chinese men about town; when they are
not actually playing, they go up into the private
boxes to the richer visitors, whom they amuse
with the last gossip of the green-room.</p>

<p>The farces are too indecent for me to do
more than give you a mere sketch of one.
Medea does not stop short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span> of doing anything
<i lang="la">coram populo</i>, so I give you a sort of Bowdler’s
family edition of the plot of one that I
saw.</p>

<p>A young gentleman of great wealth of the
name of Wang has been ruined by a mistress
named Yu Tang Chun, who, strange to say,
although his money is all spent, still preserves
a hankering for him. He, on the other hand,
finding himself without a penny, is ashamed to
go near her, so he retires to a temple to live by
his wits. The scene opens with Yu Tang Chun
bewailing his absence and her solitude in a
long recitative and song (rather pretty for
Chinese music). To her enters the low comedy
man—such a good actor, and so full of fun!—who
tells her where her lover is, and all about
his deplorable state. She determines to go
and see him, and take him a present of 300
taels (£100) to enable him to go to Peking
and pass his examination. Accordingly, she
sets out, and a table with the five offerings is
placed upon the stage to represent a temple,
to which she goes under the pretence of burning
joss stick. As soon as she sees her lover the
two set up a wild shriek, and rush into one
another’s arms. Over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span> what follows it is
absolutely necessary to draw a curtain. The play
ends by her giving Wang the money. He
starts for Peking, and returns in a second or
two, having passed a brilliant examination and
obtained high office. Sometimes, but rarely,
girls are present among the audience, and when
this is the case, it is only fair to say that these
pieces—the grossness of which passes all belief—are
not given. On those occasions the playbill
is made up of military and historic dramas,
the propriety of which is as undeniable as their
dulness.</p>

<p>The price of admission to the best theatres
at Peking is one tiao (about 8d.) to the pit,
something more to the gallery, and a private
box costs twelve tiaos. As the whole thing is,
as I said before, a speculation of the <i lang="fr">restaurateur’s</i>,
refreshments are hawked about during
the whole performance. There is a man who
carries about a long pipe (like Herr von Joel
with his cigars at Evans’s), who is very persistent
in seeking custom. If it is hot weather
the people in the pit take off their coats and
lounge naked to the waist, sitting out the whole
performance from noon till seven <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, after
which they pack up what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span> remains to them of
their fruit and melon seeds, and go off home,
not having had near enough of it.</p>

<p>I have been three or four times, and find
that a couple of hours of the din and smoke are
as much as I can stand, besides which I find
that eating po-po out of politeness interferes
with one’s dinner.</p>

<p>My time here is drawing very short. When
I told my teacher that I was going away he
hummed and hawed, and shifted about uneasily.
At last he summoned up courage and said,
“Sir, I have one last favour to ask of you.
The teachers of the West are very cunning in
medicine; they possess many secrets. I have
no child, and it is a great sorrow! Bitter is
the life of the man who is childless! In vain
have we addressed our prayers to the goddess
Kwan Yin, my wife remains barren. Sir, if
you could give me some drug or some charm to
remove this evil, for small favours one can find
thanks, but for so great a favour none!”</p>

<p>Dear to man is the fame for abstruse
learning! But I was obliged to confess myself
at fault.</p>

<p>I start for Japan on Monday week, and
then good-bye to Peking!</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent center p1">HOW MANDARINS ARE MADE</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">The</span> literature of no country is so abundant in noble
sentiments as that of China. Happy, indeed, would
be the people who should be governed according to
the precepts of Confucius, of Mencius, and of Lao Tsŭ!
The highest moral and political principles are in
every mouth, at the tip of every pen. From the
first day of his entering school the Chinese boy
learns unctuously to recite the most virtuous precepts
of the sages, yet learning is the one road to fortune
through robbery, peculation, and extortion in their
most refined shapes. With every rise in rank the
opportunities of robbing the “Hundred Names” and
defrauding the state are multiplied in a ratio increasing
like the value of carats in diamonds: the
wealth amassed by some of the great mandarins
must be something fabulous. Take as an instance
the war with Japan. The Chinese soldier, when
properly led and fairly treated is an excellent fighting
man. It is difficult to believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span> that the sons of
the braves who under Tsêng Kwo Fan and San Ko
Lin Sin, so stubbornly defended the bridge against the
French and English in 1860, could have been driven
from an impregnable position like Fort Arthur by
the Japanese some thirty years later. But what
troops could fight without food, arms, ammunition?
Food, arms, ammunition, and pay had all found their
way into the pockets of the mandarins. Would
the brigade of Guards itself have stood to be mown
down without being able to fire an effective shot in
return? I was told on high authority that at the
famous naval battle of the Yalu, which some experts
have quoted as an object lesson in the naval warfare
of the future, on the Chinese side only three live shells
were fired, one of which disabled the Japanese flagship,
and sent her steaming away into space. The
comparison of the bankers’ books of some of the
great mandarins before and after the war would be
an interesting study.</p>

<p>The mandarins—one is compelled to use the old
Portuguese word for want of a better—are recruited
from two classes: the hereditary nobility, and those
who obtain office nominally by examination, but
often by purchase.</p>

<p>The hereditary nobility is composed of the
members of the Imperial family with the five ranks,
Kung, Hou, Po, Tsŭ, Nan,—which it has been the
fashion to translate by duke, marquis, earl,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span> viscount,
baron.</p>

<p>The highest rank in the Imperial family is that
of Chin Wang—“related prince,” or as we should say
“Prince of the Blood.” In some cases this title is
continued from generation to generation; in others
there is a sliding scale downward through the ranks
of Pei Lo and Pei Tsŭ to that of Kung or duke,
below which members of the Imperial family do not
descend.</p>

<p>In the same way with subjects, the rank of Kung
is sometimes transmitted; in others the son of a
Kung becomes a Hou, the son of a Hou a Po, and so
on. The inheritor of a title must be the eldest son
of the one legitimate wife, and not of a secondary
wife, for although polygamy exists in China, there is,
except in the case of the Emperor’s family, only one
legitimately married wife, nor in her lifetime can
there be another. The younger sons of nobles, even
of the Imperial family, have no rank either by right
or by courtesy; but the latter are generally raised
to rank by being appointed general officers. Patents
of nobility cannot be bought, at any rate not in
theory.</p>

<p>The representative of the eldest branch of a
family can, in the event of his being childless, adopt
the child of a younger branch, and the child so
adopted inherits the title. It sometimes happens
that a younger brother who has become rich will
bribe his eldest brother to adopt his child to the
exclusion of the lawful heir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span> and his issue.</p>

<p>The sovereign is, as with us, the fountain of
honour, and it is he who confers these titles
of nobility, which are accompanied by grants of
land. As a general rule the land assigned to a
Kung or a Hou would not exceed a circumference
of 100 li = 33 miles, to a Po 70 li, and to the
two lesser ranks 50 li.</p>

<p>Conspicuous among the nobles of China are the
Pa Ta Chia, “the Eight great Families.” These are
the descendants of the eight Princes who, waiving
any claim to the throne, followed the reigning
dynasty from Manchuria. Their rank remains
unchanged for all generations. The representative
of one of these, the Prince of I, was famous in the
war of 1860. A year later, at the time of the Prince
of Kung’s <i lang="fr">coup d’état</i>, he fell into disgrace, and was
“presented with the white kerchief” (made to commit
suicide).</p>

<p>But the Imperial family and the hereditary nobles
at Peking, valuable instruments of obstruction as
they doubtless are, form but an infinitesimal portion
of that colossal octopus of fraud and corruption
which strangles the whole vast empire in its tentacles.
The myriads of officials, from the exalted viceroys
down to petty bloodsuckers of a rank about equal to
that of a parish beadle, are either drawn from the
so-called graduates of the examination halls, or have
obtained their promotion by purchase—of the latter
mode of reaching distinction there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span> is nothing to be
said; it is beautifully simple. But the examination
system is very complicated and deserves some
notice.</p>

<p>The following account of how mandarins are
made is based upon an article of mine, for the most
part translated from a paper by a native graduate,
and published in <i>Macmillan’s Magazine</i> in 1871&NoBreak;:&NoBreak;—</p>

<p>At the age of from six to eight years the Chinese
boy is removed from the petting and pampering of
the women’s apartments and is sent to school, where
he receives his first lessons in reading and writing as
purely mechanical processes. He is taught to read
by droning out passages from the classics in hideous
unison with his schoolmates, and to write by painting
over characters printed on thin whitey-brown paper.
This preliminary process of education lasts for some
two years or more, at the end of which the young
student is looked upon as sufficiently advanced to be
instructed in the meaning of what he reads. The
books now put into his hands are, of course, the
famous Four Books and the Five Classics, every
passage in which, with its hidden obscurities and
doubtful interpretations, is diligently and painfully
explained to him, until not only the text itself, but
also every note and commentary with which successive
ages of scholars have overlaid it, are familiar in his
mouth as household words. Having accomplished
this end the youth is allowed to try a flight upon his
own wings, and begins to write essays<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span> and poetry,
which, by useful and assiduous reading, he must
model upon the best patterns. “Poetry of the Tang
dynasty, handwriting of the Chin dynasty, essays of
the Han dynasty,” says the proverb; these, with all
humility, should the student endeavour to follow at
however great a distance.</p>

<p>As soon as the young man’s compositions begin
to take some sort of shape, and to satisfy the keen
criticism of his master, when his language is neatly
fitted to his thoughts, and he does not use so much
as a particle out of its place, he may look forward to
preparing himself to undergo his examination for the
degree of Hsin Tsai, or Bachelor of Arts.</p>

<p>The examiner for this degree is an officer from the
Han Lin (lit. Forest of Pencils), or Imperial Academy
of Peking, and is specially appointed by the
Emperor; one examiner is appointed for each province
throughout the country, and he holds his
examinations from town to town in the chief places
of the province to which he is accredited.</p>

<p>We will suppose the examination to be taking
place at Shun Ti̔en Fu, the provincial capital of
Chih Li (the province in which Peking is situated).
The examiner, having arrived with no small arrogance
of dignity, takes up his abode in the Examination
Hall inside the town. On an appointed day
the undergraduate candidates from the various Chou
and Hsien, or lesser towns which are dependent
upon Shun Ti̔en Fu, crowd into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span> hall, and take
their places each according to the township to which
he may belong. As soon as his flock is gathered
together, the examiner gives out two themes selected
from the Four Books to serve as texts for essays,
and one subject for an exercise in verse. Each
candidate is expected to produce two essays and
one set of twelve verses in rhyme; but he has
plenty of time to perform his task, for the examination
begins at four o’clock in the morning, and the
papers are not given in until between five and
seven o’clock in the evening. On the third day the
examination list is given out: the examiner writes
out the names of the successful candidates in order
of merit, and gives it to the overseers of the hall,
who, carrying it respectfully on their heads, go out
and paste it on the wall fronting the entrance gate.
Then follows a scene of excitement when the undergraduates
besiege the gate to search for their names
on the list. (Oxford over again!) “Should they
have been successful,” says a native account, “they
are now entitled to call themselves Hsin Tsai, and
are so delighted that in their joy everything in
heaven and earth seems lovely to them,” and they
look forward to the day when they will receive the
much-coveted official button.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The unhappy plucked
ones must make the best of it and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span> try again. Even
now the Hsin Tsai’s troubles are not over; for there
is a second examination, in which they are divided
into three classes—the first class being privileged
graduates eligible for honorary degrees entitling the
possessors to become candidates for bettermost civil
appointments. There is yet another distinction open
to the privileged bachelors. Once in twelve years
the degree of Pa Kung is given to a representative
of each petty township: it is also conferred on the
successful competitor in an examination held of
privileged bachelors, in which case it is awarded to
the cleverest, most respectable, and youngest of his
class. When certain official appointments of an
inferior grade are about to be made, the Emperor
summons the bachelors of the grade of Pa Kung to
court, where they are again made to go through an
examination, and divided into three classes. The
members of the first class are employed as brass
button mandarins (officials of the seventh, eighth,
and ninth classes); those of the second class are sent
to be Chih Hsien, or magistrates of small towns;
while the remainder are only eligible for employment
as assistants in the public examinations.</p>

<p>Such, briefly, are the honours and offices open to
a man who has passed his first examination. The
degree of Chü Jên is a much more serious affair.</p>

<p>This examination takes place in fixed years;
and when the appointed time comes all bachelors
ambitious of promotion, together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span> with a class of
graduates called Chien Shêng, who have purchased
their degree, prepare in fear and trembling for the
ordeal.</p>

<p>On the 6th day of the 8th month of the year an
Imperial decree is issued, appointing the officials who
are to conduct the examination. There are three
chief examiners and eighteen assistant examiners,
with a whole number of subordinates, who search
the candidates as they come in, to see that no books,
or memoranda, or other aids to intelligence, are
smuggled in; besides these there is a strong <i lang="la">posse</i>
of Imperial informers, who watch all that goes on,
and keep up a sort of secret police in the hall.
The whole of the compositions of the masters expectant
are handed over to copyists, who transcribe
them, lest the handwritings of the candidates being
recognised by the examiners there should be any
foul play, and the copies so made are compared with
the originals by clerks appointed for the purpose.
Besides all these persons, there are 180 minor
officials who superintend all petty details. The examination
is divided into three parts. On the 8th day
of the month the first part begins. The candidates
are divided into four companies, to each of which is
assigned a door. At each of the doors stand two
Imperial informers—the one a Manchu, the other a
Chinese—whose duty it is to mark off the names of
the candidates, and to distribute to each a roll of
paper, giving the number of the cell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span> allotted to him,
to which he carries his provision of food and bedding,
for he will be locked up in solitary confinement
for three days and nights. In the evening, when
the candidates have all been pricked in, every door
is sealed, and all coming in or going out is rendered
impossible.</p>

<p>The exercises set for the first part of the examination
consist of three essays from the Four Books,
and one composition in verse. The first subject is
selected, or supposed to be selected, by the Emperor
in person, and the remainder are chosen by the chief
examiners. The <i>Cycle</i>, an English newspaper published
at Shanghai, once gave the texts chosen for
such exercises at an examination held at Wu Chang.</p>

<p>I.&ensp;From the <i>Lun Yu</i>, the <i>Analects of Confucius</i>:—“Tsŭ
Yu, being governor of Wu Ching, the master
said to him, ‘Have you got such a thing as a real
Man in the place?’ He answered, ‘Here is Tan Tai
Mieh Ming, who does not in walking side off by a
short cut, nor come to my office except on public
business.’”</p>

<p>II.&ensp;From the <i>Chung Yung</i> of Kung Chi, the
grandson of Confucius:—“He only who is accomplished,
learned, profound, and critical, has wherewith
to exercise sound judgment.”</p>

<p>III.&ensp;From the <i>Shang Mang</i> of Mencius:—“When
any one told Tsŭ Lu that he had a fault he was
pleased with him. When Yu heard anybody say a
wise thing he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span> bowed to him.”</p>

<p>Each of these essays was required to contain not
less than three hundred, nor more than eight hundred
words.</p>

<p>The theme for the poetical exercise was “An
observer of the beauties of Nature being so absorbed
as to forget the march of a whole round of seasons.”</p>

<p>Such are the proofs of superior wisdom and
learning in which if a man excel he is qualified to
rule others! Chinese scholarship is very difficult
of attainment; perhaps if it were impossible the
world would hardly be much the poorer.</p>

<p>When the subjects have been selected and
approved by the Emperor, they are sealed up in a
box and given over to the care of a chief eunuch of
the palace, to be handed to the chief examiners,
who cause them to be engraved on wood and printed.
On the 10th day of the month the essays are
handed in, and the candidates leave the building.</p>

<p>The officers having received the exercises, examine
them carefully to see whether there be any
informality in them: if they should discover anything
like an infringement of prescribed custom the
papers are rejected, the peccant candidate’s name
is struck off the list, and he is incapacitated from
taking part in the second examination. If the
papers are in due form they are sent into the
copying department, where they are copied in red
ink; thence into the comparing department, and
sealing department, where the mottoes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span> borne by the
originals are pasted on to them. They now find
their way into the superintendent’s office, and he
forwards them to the eighteen junior examiners.</p>

<p>With pain and care, measuring every word and
weighing to a nicety the fitness of every particle,
these learned men apply themselves to the criticism
of the papers before them. Those that find favour
in their eyes are docketed as good, and given back
to the superintendent, who passes them to the three
chiefs. Should they fail to satisfy these they
are thrown into the waste-paper basket, but the
candidate still has the credit of having passed the
first test. Should they satisfy the chiefs they are
marked with the character Chung, signifying that
they have hit the mark; but only a limited number
of candidates are admitted to the degree at one
examination.</p>

<p>The second examination takes place on the 11th
day of the month, and consists in writing five essays
upon texts taken from the Five Classics; the third
test, which is held on the 14th of the month, is
devoted to the propounding of five sets of questions
on the subject of literature, political economy, or
general science. According to the <i>Cycle</i>, “the first
question asked at Wu Chang was of the nature of
criticism of the classics; the second question was on
historical matters; the third on military colonisation.
(The Chinese Government hoping to save
their western provinces by allotting <span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>land to soldiers
on the frontier line, requiring them to keep themselves
in readiness for fighting.) The fourth question
entered into the various plans adopted by previous
dynasties in the selection of suitable persons to hold
the offices of government. The fifth question referred
to the ancient and modern geography of Ching Chan
Fu, the course of the waters of the Han and the
Yangtze, and the history of the Tung Ting Lake.”
The answers to each of the five questions were to
contain a minimum of five hundred words.</p>

<p>It occasionally happens that after the list of
successful candidates has been made up, the work
of some new bachelor is recommended to the notice
of the examiners. Should the essays which he sends
in show pre-eminent ability, their fortunate author is
rewarded with the degree of Fu Pang, or assistant
master; and if the list of Fu Pang be already full,
then he is appointed Tan Lu, a distinction bringing
with it no advancement in rank in the state, but
rendering its possessor eligible for certain offices.</p>

<p>During the examination at Wu Chang a subordinate
official of the examination hall was convicted
of having passed manuscripts to one of the candidates.
The punishment was summary. The official
was beheaded, the candidate banished to the frontiers,
and the graduate who wrote the forged essay
was sentenced to be executed when captured. As
the writer of the article in the <i>Cycle</i>, from which I
have quoted, observes, “It is interesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span> to find the
Chinese authorities so prompt and just in punishing
the guilty. If some unfortunate foreigner had been
murdered by these precious literati, the governor
would have declared it to be impossible to touch the
offenders in the presence of a myriad of members of
their order.” More probably he would either have
declared that he could not find them, or have executed
a certain number of jail-birds as substitutes.</p>

<p>Perhaps the candidate was a foolish candidate,
and hush-money was either wanting or insufficient.
But in that case it was as it should be, for by not
bribing he clearly showed his incapacity for holding
high official position. He did not recognise the
privileges of the class which it was his ambition to
enter, and he gave the officers of the hall an opportunity
of showing a little cheap zeal in the execution
of their duty, to his great discomfiture.</p>

<p>When the three tests are ended and the degrees
have all been conferred, the superintendent of the
examination hall addresses a petition to the Emperor,
praying that a day may be fixed for publishing the
names of the successful candidates. This generally
takes place on the 10th day of the following month.
On the first day of the ceremonies of publication a
table is ordered to be set out in the hall called Chih
Kung Tang, the Hall of Justice unsurpassed. The
three chief examiners, with the two chief superintendents,
solemnly take their places at the table,
and on either side, spread out diagonally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span> “like a
goose’s wings,” as the Chinese writer puts it, are the
eighteen junior examiners, all clad in their official
robes. All this galaxy of learning and wisdom is
gathered together to witness the breaking of the
seals of the exercises, and to hear the calling out of
the names which are written on the list. Next
morning, before daybreak, the list is rolled up and
placed inside a palanquin of honour, richly decorated
with coloured silks; a procession is formed, headed
by standard-bearers carrying emblems, as at a
wedding, and the whole heaven is filled with the
sound of drums and of delicate music, gongs being
beaten to clear the road. Immediately behind the
palanquin containing the precious list march the
chief examiners and their subordinates, who accompany
it outside the Dragon Gate. This gate of the
examination hall is so called allegorically, because
in the same way as the fish rose from the sea to
heaven, and became perfected into the heavenly
dragon, so the successful candidates have, by the
grace of learning, cast off the grosser clay of which
they were formed, and have risen to the heaven of
rank and fame. The superintendents of the hall
escort the list as far as the outer gate of the provincial
capital, where it is hung up on a high
platform specially erected for the purpose.</p>

<p>When the list has thus been finally published,
etiquette requires that the new Masters of Arts
should go and pay their respects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span> to the chief and
junior examiners. At these visits much wine is
drunk, and an adjournment to the theatre takes
place, where the party witness the deadly dulness
of an historical piece, relieved, it is true, by the
performance of grossly indecent farces, and by the
consumption of the usual refreshments of fried
melon-seeds, sweetmeats, cakes, and tea.</p>

<p>In spite of all the pains taken nominally to
insure fairness and exclude any possibility of trickery,
Chinese ingenuity would belie itself if it did not find
means of giving the slip to all law and rule, and of
satisfying greed thereby. Though the candidate’s
name is not known until the papers have been
examined and judged, they will be framed in such
a way as to let the examiner know who is the
author—as, for instance, by agreeing beforehand
that the briber’s essay shall begin and end with
certain words. On the other hand, if the officers of
the copying and comparing departments have not
received their fee, they can throw any candidate’s
work all out of tune with the greatest ease. Nor
is there any appeal. The copy in red ink which is
sent in to the junior examiners stands as the <i lang="la">ipsissima
verba</i> of the writer. By one slip a spiteful copyist
may spoil the best essay.</p>

<p>The examination for the third and highest degree,
that of Chin Shih, or Doctor, does not differ materially
in character from that of Chü Jên or Master of Arts,
except in the fact that whereas the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>latter is held in
provincial capitals, the former is held only at Shun
Tien Fu, at which city the candidates from every
part of the empire have to attend. The expense
and difficulties of what may be a very long and
expensive journey naturally tend to limit the number
of aspirants.</p>

<p>After the publication of the list of successful
candidates a last examination is held at Peking in
the Imperial palace. According to their performances
in this final test the doctors are divided into three
classes. The first class consists only of the three
best men in order of merit, who are called respectively
Chuang Yüan, Pang Yüan, and Tan Hwa, which
might be translated Senior Wrangler, Second
Wrangler, and Golden Spoon; the second class
contains from seven to ten names; and the third
class is made up of the remainder, and may consist
of two hundred men or more. At the second part
of this examination the doctors are presented to
the Son of Heaven, who in person appoints them to
various offices in the state. The Senior Wrangler
is usually employed as a writer of records in the
Forest of Pencils, while the Second Wrangler and
the Golden Spoon are appointed to be correctors.
All the doctors are sure of obtaining some appointment,
but not of keeping it unless they show official
capacity, of which the most infallible proof is the
liberal opening of a long purse.</p>

<p>“In the olden time,” writes a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>native author, “a
man need only pass the degree of Hsin Tsai, or
Bachelor, to be sure of obtaining some office in the
state. But nowadays there are too many who buy
their rank, so that a man’s merit is measured by the
capacity of his purse, while the right men are pushed
out of the right place. Hence it comes that many
a ripe scholar, if he have but enough means to keep
the life within him, and be a man of spirit to boot,
will rather remain in obscurity as a private individual
than be mixed up with such men as hold office.
Good men holding aloof, the officials of the country
are but a sorry lot after all. How can we be
surprised if discontent and treason are rife?”</p>

<p>These are the words of a modern scholar, savouring
somewhat of sour grapes, it is true. Yet as
early as five hundred years before Christ, Lao Tsŭ,
the founder of the Taoist sect, pointed out the
vanity and hollowness of the system of education and
government into which the country was drifting.
“If some men,” said the sage, “would abandon their
learning and cast away their wisdom the people
would be benefited a hundred-fold.” Of all the
Chinese philosophers Lao Tsŭ was probably the one
whose teaching of simple virtue approached the
nearest to the Christian standard. Confucius himself,
after having had an interview with him, said to
his disciples, “I know how the birds fly, how the
fishes swim, how the beasts run, and the runner may
be snared, the swimmer may be <span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>hooked, and the
flyer may be shot by the arrow.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> But there is the
dragon. I cannot tell how he mounts on the wind
through the clouds and rises to heaven. To-day I
have seen Lao Tsŭ, and can only compare him to
the dragon.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p class="b2">It can hardly be said that matters have improved
since the old days of Lao Tsŭ.</p>

  into their present condition, to be in abject poverty, ignorance, and
  dejection. They knew no Hebrew, but had been instructed in copying

  seen in temples and in other places as water-spouts, where in the West
  the lion’s head would be used. The lion as a fountain comes from

<p class="p1"><i>TIMES.</i>—“Fascinating and instructive.... It is much more than a
book of travel. In her studies of the people, in her character-sketches of
the leading personalities, foreign and native, who fill the stage of the
great Chinese drama, in her quick-witted appreciation of the political
issues at stake, she shows herself an acute and well-informed observer who
has sought diligently for the solution which must underlie the mystery of a
‘land of contradictions, puzzles, and enigmas.’”</p>

<p><i>SPECTATOR.</i>—“The most brilliant and interesting picture of the
long-lived Empire that we are acquainted with.... Her knowledge is
great, her power of pictorial writing remarkable, and her style is full of
light and grace.”</p>

<p><i>PILOT.</i>—“A very readable book, crammed with information of many
topics, and telling of many curious sights.”</p>

<p><i>PALL MALL GAZETTE.</i>—“A most charming and readable
book.... Once taken up the book is as hard to put down as a good
novel.... We cannot too strongly recommend the perusal of this book
to all at the present time. It will serve as a most admirable commentary
to the all-engrossing events now passing in the Far East. There are
many good illustrations.”</p>

<p><i>DAILY NEWS.</i>—“The book is to be recommended as a lively and
vivid account of Chinese life and character. With its sketches of scenes
and persons wherewith the entire world is now concerned, ‘China, the
Long-lived Empire’ appears at an opportune moment. It contains a
large number of good illustrations.”</p>

<p><i>DAILY CHRONICLE.</i>—“Miss Scidmore unites to the keen and
sympathetic observation of a travelled woman the judicial mind of a
veteran judge. This is high praise, we know, but nobody who has studied
China and reads this book will think it exaggerated.”</p>

<p><i>ST. JAMES’S GAZETTE.</i>—“Her book is certain to be widely
read, and it is deserving of study in all respects. The portraits and other
illustrations are extremely interesting.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
